1. 
The morning breaks, the shadows flee;
Lo, Zionâs standard is unfurled!
The dawning of a brighter day,
The dawning of a brighter day
Majestic rises on the world.
2. 
The clouds of error disappear
Before the rays of truth divine;
The glory bursting from afar,
The glory bursting from afar
Wide oâer the nations soon will shine.
3. 
The Gentile fulness now comes in,
And Israelâs blessings are at hand.
Lo, Judahâs remnant, cleansed from sin,
Lo, Judahâs remnant, cleansed from sin,
Shall in their promised Canaan stand.
4. 
Jehovah speaks! Let earth give ear,
And Gentile nations turn and live.
His mighty arm is making bare,
His mighty arm is making bare
His covânant people to receive.
5. 
âAngels from heavân and truth from earth
Have met, and both have record borne;
Thus Zionâs light is bursting forth,
Thus Zionâs light is bursting forth
To bring her ransomed children home.
1. 
The Spirit of God like a fire is burning!
The latter-day glory begins to come forth;
The visions and blessings of old are returning,
And angels are coming to visit the earth.
2. 
The Lord is extending the Saintsâ understanding,
Restoring their judges and all as at first.
The knowledge and power of God are expanding;
The veil oâer the earth is beginning to burst.
3. 
Weâll call in our solemn assemblies in spirit,
To spread forth the kingdom of heaven abroad,
That we through our faith may begin to inherit
The visions and blessings and glories of God.
4. 
How blessed the day when the lamb and the lion
Shall lie down together without any ire,
And Ephraim be crowned with his blessing in Zion,
As Jesus descends with his chariot of fire!
1. 
Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation.
No longer as strangers on earth need we roam.
Good tidings are sounding to us and each nation,
And shortly the hour of redemption will come,
When all that was promised the Saints will be given,
And none will molest them from morn until evân,
And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden,
And Jesus will say to all Israel, âCome home.â
2. 
Weâll love one another and never dissemble
But cease to do evil and ever be one.
And when the ungodly are fearing and tremble,
Weâll watch for the day when the Savior will come,
When all that was promised the Saints will be given,
And none will molest them from morn until evân,
And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden,
And Jesus will say to all Israel, âCome home.â
3. 
In faith weâll rely on the arm of Jehovah
To guide thru these last days of trouble and gloom,
And after the scourges and harvest are over,
Weâll rise with the just when the Savior doth come.
Then all that was promised the Saints will be given,
And they will be crownâd with the angels of heavân,
And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden,
And Christ and his people will ever be one.
1. 
Truth eternal, truth divine,
In thine ancient fulness shine!
Burst the fetters of the mind
From the millions of mankind!
2. 
Truth again restored to earth,
Opened with a prophetâs birth.
Priests of heavenâs royal line
Bear the keys of truth divine!
3. 
Truth shall triumph as the light
Chases far the misty night.
Endless ages own its sway,
Clad in everlasting day.
1. 
High on the mountain top
A banner is unfurled.
Ye nations, now look up;
It waves to all the world.
In Deseretâs sweet, peaceful land,
On Zionâs mount behold it stand!
2. 
For God remembers still
His promise made of old
That he on Zionâs hill
Truthâs standard would unfold!
Her light should there attract the gaze
Of all the world in latter days.
3. 
His house shall there be reared,
His glory to display,
And people shall be heard
In distant lands to say:
Weâll now go up and serve the Lord,
Obey his truth and learn his word.
4. 
For there we shall be taught
The law that will go forth,
With truth and wisdom fraught,
To govern all the earth.
Forever there his ways weâll tread,
And save ourselves with all our dead.
1. 
Redeemer of Israel,
Our only delight,
On whom for a blessing we call,
Our shadow by day
And our pillar by night,
Our King, our Delivârer, our all!
2. 
We know he is coming
To gather his sheep
And lead them to Zion in love,
For why in the valley
Of death should they weep
Or in the lone wilderness rove?
3. 
How long we have wandered
As strangers in sin
And cried in the desert for thee!
Our foes have rejoiced
When our sorrows theyâve seen,
But Israel will shortly be free.
4. 
As children of Zion,
Good tidings for us.
The tokens already appear.
Fear not, and be just,
For the kingdom is ours.
The hour of redemption is near.
5. 
Restore, my dear Savior,
The light of thy face;
Thy soul-cheering comfort impart;
And let the sweet longing
For thy holy place
Bring hope to my desolate heart.
6. 
He looks! and ten thousands
Of angels rejoice,
And myriads wait for his word;
He speaks! and eternity,
Filled with his voice,
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.
1. 
Israel, Israel, God is calling,
Calling thee from lands of woe.
Babylon the great is falling;
God shall all her towârs oâerthrow.
Come to Zion, come to Zion
Ere his floods of anger flow.
Come to Zion, come to Zion
Ere his floods of anger flow.
2. 
Israel, Israel, God is speaking.
Hear your great Delivârerâs voice!
Now a glorious morn is breaking
For the people of his choice.
Come to Zion, come to Zion,
And within her walls rejoice.
Come to Zion, come to Zion,
And within her walls rejoice.
3. 
Israel, angels are descending
From celestial worlds on high,
And to man their powâr extending,
That the Saints may homeward fly.
Come to Zion, come to Zion,
For your coming Lord is nigh.
Come to Zion, come to Zion,
For your coming Lord is nigh.
4. 
Israel! Israel! Canst thou linger
Still in errorâs gloomy ways?
Mark how judgmentâs pointing finger
Justifies no vain delays.
Come to Zion, come to Zion!
Zionâs walls shall ring with praise.
Come to Zion, come to Zion!
Zionâs walls shall ring with praise.
1. 
Awake and arise, O ye slumbering nations!
The heavens have opened their portals again.
The last and the greatest of all dispensations
Has burst like a dawn oâer the children of men!
2. 
The dream of the poet, the crown of the ages,
The time which the prophets of Israel foretold,
That glorious day only dreamed by the sages
Is yours, O ye slumbering nations; behold!
3. 
Oh, lift up your voices in song and in story.
Let banners of peace in all lands be unfurled,
For truth, heaven-born, in its beauty and glory
Is marching triumphantly over the world.
1. 
Come, rejoice, the King of glory
Speaks to earth again.
Gladsome words ring out from heaven,
Joyous, wondrous strain.
Truth bursts forth in radiant light,
Showing all the path of right.
Shout hosanna to his name;
One and all his might proclaim.
2. 
Angels, messengers from heaven,
Come to earth once more;
Bring to men the glorious gospel;
Priceless truths restore.
Let all hear who live today!
This is life, the truth, the way.
Shout hosanna to his name;
One and all his might proclaim.
3. 
Great, oh, great is Christ our Savior.
None can stay his hand.
Now he brings to us salvation,
Cheering evâry land.
Sing, rejoice, the King of love
Speaks to earth from heavân above.
Shout hosanna to his name;
One and all his might proclaim.
1. 
Come, sing to the Lord, his name to praise.
He in these latter days did raise
A prophet to his name,
The blessed gospel to restore.
Come, sing to the Lord, his name adore!
2. 
The prophets of old beheld this day,
Its glory told in wondrous lay.
They saw our prophet dear,
Who times of fulness ushered in.
Come, sing to the Lord, his praises ring!
3. 
The keys of the priesthood of our Lord
To us in fulness are restored,
Their blessings to bestow,
And powârs divine are manifest.
Come, sing to the Lord, his name be blessed!
1. 
What was witnessed in the heavens?
Why, an angel earthward bound.
Had he something with him bringing?
Yes, the gospel, joyful sound!
It was to be preached in power
On the earth, the angel said,
To all men, all tongues and nations
That upon its face are spread.
2. 
Had we not before the gospel?
Yes, it came of old to men.
Then what is this latter gospel?
âTis the first one come again.
This was preached by Paul and Peter
And by Jesus Christ, the Head.
This we latter Saints are preaching;
We their footsteps wish to tread.
3. 
Where so long has been the gospel?
Did it pass from earth away?
Yes, âtwas taken back to heaven
Till should dawn a brighter day.
What became of those departed,
Knowing not the gospel plan?
In the spirit world theyâll hear it;
God is just to evâry man.
1. 
âTwas witnessed in the morning sky:
An angel earthward bound.
This messenger proclaimed anew
The gospelâs joyful sound.
In powâr it would be preached on earth
By men of God ordained;
All men, all tongues, all nations would
Accept and praise his name.
2. 
In ancient days the gospel plan
Was givân of God to men;
In latter days the gospel is
Restored to earth again.
By holy prophets long proclaimed,
By Saints and seers adored,
It speaks the everlasting truths
Of Jesus Christ, the Lord.
3. 
Apostles of a former day
To modern prophets came;
They brought the priesthood of our Lord
To bless the earth again.
The powârs of heavân are opened wide
To men of God below;
The knowledge, gifts, and keys are ours,
All blessings to bestow.
1. 
An angel from on high
The long, long silence broke;
Descending from the sky,
These gracious words he spoke:
Lo! in Cumorahâs lonely hill
A sacred record lies concealed.
Lo! in Cumorahâs lonely hill
A sacred record lies concealed.
2. 
Sealed by Moroniâs hand,
It has for ages lain
To wait the Lordâs command,
From dust to speak again.
It shall again to light come forth
To usher in Christâs reign on earth.
It shall again to light come forth
To usher in Christâs reign on earth.
3. 
It speaks of Josephâs seed
And makes the remnant known
Of nations long since dead,
Who once had dwelt alone.
The fulness of the gospel, too,
Its pages will reveal to view.
The fulness of the gospel, too,
Its pages will reveal to view.
4. 
The time is now fulfilled,
The long-expected day;
Let earth obedience yield
And darkness flee away.
Remove the seals; be wide unfurled
Its light and glory to the world.
Remove the seals; be wide unfurled
Its light and glory to the world.
5. 
Lo! Israel filled with joy
Shall now be gathered home,
Their wealth and means employ
To build Jerusalem,
While Zion shall arise and shine
And fill the earth with truth divine.
While Zion shall arise and shine
And fill the earth with truth divine.
1. 
Sweet is the peace the gospel brings
To seeking minds and true.
With light refulgent on its wings,
It clears the human view.
2. 
Its laws and precepts are divine
And show a Fatherâs care.
Transcendent love and mercy shine
In each injunction there.
3. 
Faithless tradition flees its powâr,
And unbelief gives way.
The gloomy clouds, which used to lowâr,
Submit to reasonâs sway.
4. 
May we who know the sacred Name
From every sin depart.
Then will the Spiritâs constant flame
Preserve us pure in heart.
5. 
Ere long the tempterâs power will cease,
And sin no more annoy,
No wrangling sects disturb our peace,
Or mar our heartfelt joy.
6. 
That which we have in part received
Will be in part no more,
For he in whom we all believe
To us will all restore.
7. 
In patience, then, let us possess
Our souls till he appear.
On to our mark of calling press;
Redemption draweth near.
1. 
I saw a mighty angel fly;
To earth he bent his way,
A message bearing from on high
To cheer the sons of day.
Truth is the message which he bears,
The gospelâs joyful sound,
To calm our doubts, to chase our fears,
And make our joys abound.
2. 
He cries, and with a mighty voice;
Ye nations lend an ear,
And isles and continents rejoice:
The great Redeemerâs near!
He cries; let evâry ear attend,
And thrones and empires all!
Fear God, and make the Lord your friend,
The King, the Lord of all!
3. 
Fear God, who made the water pure,
The heavens, sea, and land.
His judgment will be swift and sure;
The day is nigh at hand.
Then, all ye people, worship God;
Give glory to his name!
To spread these tidings far abroad
The holy angel came.
1. 
What glorious scenes mine eyes behold!
What wonders burst upon my view!
When Ephraimâs records I unfold,
All things appear divinely new.
All things appear divinely new.
2. 
Good news to earth have angels borne,
Which fills our souls with joy and peace.
Good tidings comfort those who mourn
And bring the captive full release,
And bring the captive full release.
3. 
The scattered sheep, who once were sold
In darkness oâer the mountains far,
Shall now return unto their fold
And there their waiting hearts prepare,
And there their waiting hearts prepare.
4. 
Now Israel, long oppressed and grieved
In evâry land, in evâry clime,
Shall hear the word of God and live;
This is the time, the chosen time.
This is the time, the chosen time.
1. 
Awake, ye Saints of God, awake!
Call on the Lord in mighty prayer
That he will Zionâs bondage break
And bring to naught the tempterâs snare,
And bring to naught the tempterâs snare.
2. 
Tho Zionâs foes have counseled deep,
Although they bind with fetters strong,
The God of Jacob does not sleep;
His vengeance will not slumber long;
His vengeance will not slumber long.
3. 
With constant faith and fervent prayer,
With deep humility of soul,
With steadfast mind and heart, prepare
To see thâeternal purpose roll,
To see thâeternal purpose roll.
4. 
Awake to righteousness; be one,
Or, saith the Lord, âYe are not mine!â
Yea, like the Father and the Son,
Let all the Saints in union join.
Let all the Saints in union join.
1. 
The voice of God again is heard.
The silence has been broken.
The curse of darkness is withdrawn.
The Lord from heavân has spoken.
Rejoice, ye living and ye dead!
Rejoice, for your salvation
Begins anew this happy morn
Of final dispensation.
2. 
O messengers of truth, go forth,
Proclaim the gospel story,
Go forth the nations to prepare
To greet the King of glory.
We shout hosanna, shout again,
Till all creation blending
Shall join in one great, grand amen
Of anthems never ending.
1. 
We thank thee, O God, for a prophet
To guide us in these latter days.
We thank thee for sending the gospel
To lighten our minds with its rays.
We thank thee for every blessing
Bestowed by thy bounteous hand.
We feel it a pleasure to serve thee
And love to obey thy command.
2. 
When dark clouds of trouble hang oâer us
And threaten our peace to destroy,
There is hope smiling brightly before us,
And we know that delivârance is nigh.
We doubt not the Lord nor his goodness.
Weâve proved him in days that are past.
The wicked who fight against Zion
Will surely be smitten at last.
3. 
Weâll sing of his goodness and mercy.
Weâll praise him by day and by night,
Rejoice in his glorious gospel,
And bask in its life-giving light.
Thus on to eternal perfection
The honest and faithful will go,
While they who reject this glad message
Shall never such happiness know.
1. 
God of power, God of right,
Guide us with thy priesthoodâs might.
Forge our souls in living fire;
Shape them to thy great desire.
2. 
God of wisdom, God of truth,
Take us in our eager youth;
Lift us step by step to thee
Thru an endless ministry.
3. 
God of mercy, God of love,
Let thy Spirit, like the dove,
Touch and humble, teach and bless,
As we serve in holiness.
1. 
Come, listen to a prophetâs voice,
And hear the word of God,
And in the way of truth rejoice,
And sing for joy aloud.
Weâve found the way the prophets went
Who lived in days of yore.
Another prophet now is sent
This knowledge to restore.
2. 
The gloom of sullen darkness spread
Thru earthâs extended space
Is banished by our living Head,
And God has shown his face.
Thru erring schemes in days now past
The world has gone astray;
Yet Saints of God have found at last
The straight and narrow way.
3. 
âTis not in man they put their trust
Nor on his arm rely.
Full well assured, all are accursed
Who Jesus Christ deny.
The Savior to his people saith,
âLet all my words obey,
And signs shall follow living faith,
Down to the latest day.â
4. 
Then heed the words of truth and light
That flow from fountains pure.
Yea, keep His law with all thy might
Till thine electionâs sure,
Till thou shalt hear the holy voice
Assure eternal reign,
While joy and cheer attend thy choice,
As one who shall obtain.
1. 
We listen to a prophetâs voice and hear the Savior too.
With love he bids us do the work the Lord would have us do.
The Savior calls his chosen seer to preach the word of God,
That men might learn to find the path marked by the iron rod.
2. 
In evâry land, in evâry tongue, our prophet will be heard;
How swiftly round the world his voice reveals the gospel word!
The sacred message that he brings will witness and agree
With evâry prophet called of God throughout earthâs history.
3. 
Hosanna! Let our praise ascend unto the Saviorâs throne;
Rejoice! The prophet has confirmed that by Him we are known.
Attend, ye earth! The prophet speaks; come listen and obey.
He is the man who holds the keys of priesthood powâr today.
1. 
We ever pray for thee, our prophet dear,
That God will give to thee comfort and cheer;
As the advancing years furrow thy brow,
Still may the light within shine bright as now,
Still may the light within shine bright as now.
2. 
We ever pray for thee with all our hearts,
That strength be given thee to do thy part,
To guide and counsel us from day to day,
To shed a holy light around our way,
To shed a holy light around our way.
3. 
We ever pray for thee with fervent love;
And as the childrenâs prayer is heard above,
Thou shalt be ever blest, and God will give
All that is meet and best while thou shalt live,
All that is meet and best while thou shalt live.
1. 
God bless our prophet dear;
May health and comfort cheer
His noble heart.
His words with fire impress
On souls that thou wilt bless
To choose in righteousness
The better part.
2. 
So shall thy kingdom spread,
As by thy prophets said,
From sea to sea.
Truth burns in evâry soul;
As one united whole,
We hasten to the goal
We long to see.
3. 
Oh, may thy Saints be one,
Like Father and the Son,
Nor disagree.
United heart and hand,
So may we ever stand,
A firm and valiant band
Eternally.
1. 
Now weâll sing with one accord,
For a prophet of the Lord,
Bringing forth his precious word,
Cheers the Saints as anciently.
When the world in darkness lay,
Lo! he sought the better way,
And he heard the Savior say,
âGo and prune my vineyard, son!â
2. 
And an angel surely then,
For a blessing unto men,
Brought the priesthood back again
In its ancient purity.
Even Joseph he inspired;
Yea, his heart he truly fired
With the light that he desired
For the work of righteousness.
3. 
And the Book of Mormon true,
With its covânant ever new,
For the Gentile and the Jew,
He translated sacredly.
Godâs commandments to mankind,
For believing Saints designed,
And to bless the seeking mind,
Came to him from Jesus Christ.
4. 
Precious are the years to come,
While the righteous gather home
For the great millennium,
When theyâll rest in blessedness.
Prudent in this world of woes,
They will triumph oâer their foes,
While the realm of Zion grows
Purer for eternity.
1. 
Oh, how lovely was the morning!
Radiant beamed the sun above.
Bees were humming, sweet birds singing,
Music ringing thru the grove,
When within the shady woodland
Joseph sought the God of love,
When within the shady woodland
Joseph sought the God of love.
2. 
Humbly kneeling, sweet appealingâ
âTwas the boyâs first uttered prayerâ
When the powârs of sin assailing
Filled his soul with deep despair;
But undaunted, still he trusted
In his Heavânly Fatherâs care,
But undaunted, still he trusted
In his Heavânly Fatherâs care.
3. 
Suddenly a light descended,
Brighter far than noonday sun,
And a shining, glorious pillar
Oâer him fell, around him shone,
While appeared two heavânly beings,
God the Father and the Son,
While appeared two heavânly beings,
God the Father and the Son.
4. 
âJoseph, this is my Beloved;
Hear him!â Oh, how sweet the word!
Josephâs humble prayer was answered,
And he listened to the Lord.
Oh, what rapture filled his bosom,
For he saw the living God,
Oh, what rapture filled his bosom,
For he saw the living God.
1. 
Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!
Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer.
Blessed to open the last dispensation,
Kings shall extol him, and nations revere.
2. 
Praise to his memâry, he died as a martyr;
Honored and blest be his ever great name!
Long shall his blood, which was shed by assassins,
Plead unto heavân while the earth lauds his fame.
3. 
Great is his glory and endless his priesthood.
Ever and ever the keys he will hold.
Faithful and true, he will enter his kingdom,
Crowned in the midst of the prophets of old.
4. 
Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven;
Earth must atone for the blood of that man.
Wake up the world for the conflict of justice.
Millions shall know âBrother Josephâ again.
1. 
Saints, behold how great Jehovah
Hath his blessings on you shed.
Zion evârywhere is growing
As the gospel light is spread!
2. 
Out of all past dispensations,
God is bringing into one
Evâry truth by prophets spoken,
For the last days have begun.
3. 
Rise and lift up Zionâs standard;
Tell our Fatherâs children now:
Heavenâs blessed King approaches;
All men must before him bow.
1. 
A poor wayfaring Man of grief
Hath often crossed me on my way,
Who sued so humbly for relief
That I could never answer nay.
I had not powâr to ask his name,
Whereto he went, or whence he came;
Yet there was something in his eye
That won my love; I knew not why.
2. 
Once, when my scanty meal was spread,
He entered; not a word he spake,
Just perishing for want of bread.
I gave him all; he blessed it, brake,
And ate, but gave me part again.
Mine was an angelâs portion then,
For while I fed with eager haste,
The crust was manna to my taste.
3. 
I spied him where a fountain burst
Clear from the rock; his strength was gone.
The heedless water mocked his thirst;
He heard it, saw it hurrying on.
I ran and raised the suffârer up;
Thrice from the stream he drained my cup,
Dipped and returned it running oâer;
I drank and never thirsted more.
4. 
âTwas night; the floods were out; it blew
A winter hurricane aloof.
I heard his voice abroad and flew
To bid him welcome to my roof.
I warmed and clothed and cheered my guest
And laid him on my couch to rest,
Then made the earth my bed and seemed
In Edenâs garden while I dreamed.
5. 
Stript, wounded, beaten nigh to death,
I found him by the highway side.
I roused his pulse, brought back his breath,
Revived his spirit, and supplied
Wine, oil, refreshmentâhe was healed.
I had myself a wound concealed,
But from that hour forgot the smart,
And peace bound up my broken heart.
6. 
In prisân I saw him next, condemned
To meet a traitorâs doom at morn.
The tide of lying tongues I stemmed,
And honored him âmid shame and scorn.
My friendshipâs utmost zeal to try,
He asked if I for him would die.
The flesh was weak; my blood ran chill,
But my free spirit cried, âI will!â
7. 
Then in a moment to my view
The stranger started from disguise.
The tokens in his hands I knew;
The Savior stood before mine eyes.
He spake, and my poor name he named,
âOf me thou hast not been ashamed.
These deeds shall thy memorial be;
Fear not, thou didst them unto me.â
1. 
Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;
But with joy wend your way.
Though hard to you this journey may appear,
Grace shall be as your day.
âTis better far for us to strive
Our useless cares from us to drive;
Do this, and joy your hearts will swellâ
All is well! All is well!
2. 
Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard?
âTis not so; all is right.
Why should we think to earn a great reward
If we now shun the fight?
Gird up your loins; fresh courage take.
Our God will never us forsake;
And soon weâll have this tale to tellâ
All is well! All is well!
3. 
Weâll find the place which God for us prepared,
Far away in the West,
Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid;
There the Saints will be blessed.
Weâll make the air with music ring,
Shout praises to our God and King;
Above the rest these words weâll tellâ
All is well! All is well!
4. 
And should we die before our journeyâs through,
Happy day! All is well!
We then are free from toil and sorrow, too;
With the just we shall dwell!
But if our lives are spared again
To see the Saints their rest obtain,
Oh, how weâll make this chorus swellâ
All is well! All is well!
1. 
O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.
2. 
Within the shadow of thy throne,
Still may we dwell secure.
Sufficient is thine arm alone,
And our defense is sure.
3. 
Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting thou art God,
To endless years the same.
4. 
O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be thou our guide while life shall last
And our eternal home.
1. 
The happy day at last has come.
The truth restored is now made known.
The promised angelâs come again
To introduce Messiahâs reign.
2. 
The gospel trump again is heard.
The truth from darkness has appeared.
The lands which long benighted lay
Have now beheld a glorious day:
3. 
The day by prophets long foretold,
The day which Abram did behold,
The day that Saints desired so long,
When God his great work would perform,
4. 
The day when Saints again shall hear
The voice of Jesus in their ear,
And angels, who above do reign,
Come down to speak again with men.
1. 
Our mountain home so dear,
Where crystal waters clear
Flow ever free,
Flow ever free,
While thru the valleys wide
The flowârs on evâry side,
Blooming in stately pride,
Are fair to see.
2. 
Weâll roam the verdant hills
And by the sparkling rills
Pluck the wildflowârs,
Pluck the wildflowârs;
The fragrance on the air,
The landscape bright and fair,
And sunshine evârywhere
Make pleasant hours.
3. 
In sylvan depth and shade,
In forest and in glade,
Where-eâer we pass,
Where-eâer we pass,
The hand of God we see
In leaf and bud and tree,
Or bird or humming bee,
Or blade of grass.
4. 
The streamlet, flowâr, and sod
Bespeak the works of God;
And all combine,
And all combine,
With most transporting grace,
His handiwork to trace,
Thru natureâs smiling face,
In art divine.
1. 
O ye mountains high, where the clear blue sky
Arches over the vales of the free,
Where the pure breezes blow and the clear streamlets flow,
How Iâve longed to your bosom to flee!
O Zion! dear Zion! land of the free,
Now my own mountain home, unto thee I have come;
All my fond hopes are centered in thee.
2. 
Tho the great and the wise all thy beauties despise,
To the humble and pure thou art dear;
Tho the haughty may smile and the wicked revile,
Yet we love thy glad tidings to hear.
O Zion! dear Zion! home of the free,
Tho thou wert forced to fly to thy chambers on high,
Yet weâll share joy and sorrow with thee.
3. 
In thy mountain retreat, God will strengthen thy feet;
Without fear of thy foes thou shalt tread;
And their silver and gold, as the prophets have told,
Shall be brought to adorn thy fair head.
O Zion! dear Zion! home of the free,
Soon thy towers shall shine with a splendor divine,
And eternal thy glory shall be.
4. 
Here our voices weâll raise, and weâll sing to thy praise,
Sacred home of the prophets of God.
Thy delivârance is nigh; thy oppressors shall die;
And thy land shall be freedomâs abode.
O Zion! dear Zion! land of the free,
In thy temples weâll bend; all thy rights weâll defend;
And our home shall be ever with thee.
1. 
For the strength of the hills we bless thee,
Our God, our fathersâ God;
Thou hast made thy children mighty
By the touch of the mountain sod.
Thou hast led thy chosen Israel
To freedomâs last abode;
2. 
At the hands of foul oppressors
Weâve borne and suffered long;
Thou hast been our help in weakness,
And thy powâr hath made us strong.
Amid ruthless foes outnumbered
In weariness we trod;
3. 
Thou hast led us here in safety
Where the mountain bulwark stands
As the guardian of the loved ones
Thou hast brought from many lands.
For the rock and for the river,
The valleyâs fertile sod,
4. 
We are watchers of a beacon
Whose light must never die;
We are guardians of an altar
âMidst the silence of the sky.
Here the rocks yield founts of courage,
Struck forth as by thy rod;
1. 
They, the builders of the nation,
Blazing trails along the way;
Stepping-stones for generations
Were their deeds of evâry day.
Building new and firm foundations,
Pushing on the wild frontier,
Forging onward, ever onward,
Blessed, honored Pioneer!
2. 
Service ever was their watchcry;
Love became their guiding star;
Courage, their unfailing beacon,
Radiating near and far.
Evâry day some burden lifted,
Evâry day some heart to cheer,
Evâry day some hope the brighter,
Blessed, honored Pioneer!
3. 
As an ensign to the nation,
They unfurled the flag of truth,
Pillar, guide, and inspiration
To the hosts of waiting youth.
Honor, praise, and veneration
To the founders we revere!
List our song of adoration,
Blessed, honored Pioneer!
1. 
The wintry day, descending to its close,
Invites all wearied nature to repose,
And shades of night are falling dense and fast,
Like sable curtains closing oâer the past.
Pale through the gloom the newly fallen snow
Wraps in a shroud the silent earth below
As tho âtwere mercyâs hand had spread the pall,
A symbol of forgiveness unto all.
2. 
I cannot go to rest, but linger still
In meditation at my windowsill,
While, like the twinkling stars in heavenâs dome,
Come one by one sweet memories of home.
And wouldst thou ask me where my fancy roves
To reproduce the happy scenes it loves,
Where hope and memory together dwell
And paint the pictured beauties that I tell?
3. 
Away beyond the prairies of the West,
Where exiled Saints in solitude were blest,
Where industry the seal of wealth has set
Amid the peaceful vales of Deseret,
Unheeding still the fiercest blasts that blow,
With tops encrusted by eternal snow,
The towâring peaks that shield the tender sod
Stand, types of freedom reared by natureâs God.
4. 
The wilderness, that naught before would yield,
Is now become a fertile, fruitful field.
Where roamed at will the fearless Indian band,
The templed cities of the Saints now stand.
And sweet religion in its purity
Invites all men to its security.
There is my home, the spot I love so well,
Whose worth and beauty pen nor tongue can tell.
1. 
Come, all ye Saints of Zion,
And let us praise the Lord;
His ransomed are returning,
According to his word.
In sacred song and gladness
They walk the narrow way
And thank the Lord who brought them
To see the latter day.
2. 
Come, ye dispersed of Judah,
Join in the theme and sing
With harmony unceasing
The praises of our King,
Whose arm is now extended,
On which the world may gaze,
To gather up the righteous
In these the latter days.
3. 
Rejoice, rejoice, O Israel,
And let your joys abound!
The voice of God shall reach you
Wherever you are found
And call you back from bondage,
That you may sing his praise
In Zion and Jerusalem,
In these the latter days.
4. 
Then gather up for Zion,
Ye Saints thruout the land,
And clear the way before you,
As God shall give command.
Tho wicked men and devils
Exert their powâr, âtis vain,
Since He who is eternal
Has said you shall obtain.
1. 
O Saints of Zion, hear the voice
Of Him from courts on high.
Prepare the pathway of the Lord;
His reign on earth is nigh.
Prepare the supper of the Lamb;
Invite the world to dine.
Behold, the mighty Bridegroom comes
In majesty divine.
2. 
Entreat the Lord in humble prayer
That all the sons of men
His righteous kingdom will receive
And shout the glad âamen.â
The sacred keys are now restored;
Declare the gospel plan.
Make known the wondrous words of truth
Revealed again to man.
3. 
Behold, the glory of the Lord
Sets Zionâs mount aglow,
For Zion is an ensign pure;
All nations to her flow.
O Saints of Zion, tread the paths
Your faithful fathers trod.
Lift up your hearts in gratitude
And serve the living God!
1. 
Arise, O glorious Zion,
Thou joy of latter days,
Whom countless Saints rely on
To gain a resting place.
Arise and shine in splendor
Amid the worldâs deep night,
For God, thy sure defender,
Is now thy life and light.
2. 
From Zionâs favored dwelling
The gospel issues forth,
The covenant revealing
To gather all the earth;
And Saints, the message bringing
To all the sons of men,
With the redeemed shall, singing,
To Zion come again.
3. 
Thru painful tribulation
We walk the narrow road
And battle with temptation
To gain the blest abode.
But patient, firm endurance,
With glory in our view,
The Spiritâs bright assurance
Will bring us conqârors through.
4. 
Oh, grant, Eternal Father,
That we may faithful be,
With all the just to gather,
And thy salvation see!
Then, with the hosts of heaven,
Weâll sing thâimmortal theme:
To him be glory given
Whose blood did us redeem.
1. 
Let Zion in her beauty rise;
Her light begins to shine.
Ere long her King will rend the skies,
Majestic and divine,
The gospel spreading thru the land,
A people to prepare
To meet the Lord and Enochâs band
Triumphant in the air.
2. 
Ye heralds, sound the golden trump
To earthâs remotest bound.
Go spread the news from pole to pole
In all the nations round:
That Jesus in the clouds above,
With hosts of angels too,
Will soon appear, his Saints to save,
His enemies subdue.
3. 
That glorious rest will then commence
Which prophets did foretell,
When Saints will reign with Christ on earth,
And in his presence dwell
A thousand years, oh, glorious day!
Dear Lord, prepare my heart
To stand with thee on Zionâs mount
And nevermore to part.
1. 
Hail to the brightness of Zionâs glad morning!
Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning.
Zion in triumph begins her glad reign.
2. 
Hail to the brightness of Zionâs glad morning,
Long by the prophets of Israel foretold!
Hail to the millions from bondage returning!
Gentiles and Jews the glad vision behold.
3. 
Lo! in the desert the flowers are springing;
Streams, ever copious, are gliding along.
Loud from the mountaintops echoes are ringing;
Wastes rise in verdure and mingle in song.
4. 
Hark! from all lands, from the isles of the ocean,
Praise to Jehovah ascending on high.
Fallen the engines of war and commotion;
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
1. 
Zion stands with hill surroundedâ
Zion, kept by powâr divine.
All her foes shall be confounded,
Though the world in arms combine.
Happy Zion, Happy Zion,
What a favored lot is thine!
2. 
Evâry human tie may perish,
Friend to friend unfaithful prove,
Mothers cease their own to cherish,
Heavân and earth at last remove.
But no changes, But no changes
Can attend Jehovahâs love.
3. 
In the furnace God may prove thee,
Thence to bring thee forth more bright,
But can never cease to love thee;
Thou art precious in his sight.
God is with thee, God is with thee;
Thou shalt triumph in his might.
1. 
Beautiful Zion, built above;
Beautiful city that I love;
Beautiful gates of pearly white;
Beautiful templeâGod its light;
He who was slain on Calvary
Opens those pearly gates for me.
2. 
Beautiful heavân, where all is light;
Beautiful angels clothed in white;
Beautiful strains that never tire;
Beautiful harps thru all the choir;
There shall I join the chorus sweet,
Worshiping at the Saviorâs feet.
3. 
Beautiful crowns on evâry brow;
Beautiful palms the conqârors show;
Beautiful robes the ransomed wear;
Beautiful all who enter there;
Thither I press with eager feet;
There shall my rest be long and sweet.
1. 
Lead me into life eternal
By the gospelâs holy call.
Let thy promise rest upon me;
Grant me ready strength for all.
2. 
Father, all my heart I give thee;
All my service shall be thine.
Guide me as I search in weakness;
Let thy loving light be mine.
3. 
Hear me as I pray in meekness;
Let my strength be as thy day.
Give me faith, the greater knowledge;
Father, bless me as I pray.
1. 
Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God!
He whose word cannot be broken
Chose thee for his own abode.
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake our sure repose?
With salvationâs wall surrounded,
Thou mayâst smile on all thy foes.
2. 
See! the streams of living waters,
Springing from celestial love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters
And all fear of drought remove.
Round each habitation hovâring,
See the cloud and fire appear
For a glory and a covâring,
Showing that the Lord is near.
3. 
Blest inhabitants of Zion,
Purchased by the Saviorâs blood;
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
Makes them kings and priests to God.
While in love his Saints he raises,
With himself to reign as King,
All, as priests, his solemn praises
For thank-offârings freely bring.
1. 
We will sing of Zion,
Kingdom of our God.
Zion is the pure in heart,
Those who seek the Saviorâs part.
Zion soon in all the world
Will rise to meet her God.
2. 
Thru the revelations
Givân by God to men,
Heavenâs truth is placed on earth;
Prophets teach its powâr and worth.
Zion readies us to see
The Savior come again.
3. 
When the Saints of Zion
Keep his law in truth,
Hate and war and strife will cease;
Men will live in love and peace.
Heavânly Zion, come once more
And cover all the earth.
1. 
Glorious things are sung of Zion,
Enochâs city seen of old,
Where the righteous, being perfect,
Walked with God in streets of gold.
Love and virtue, faith and wisdom,
Grace and gifts were all combined.
As himself each loved his neighbor;
All were one in heart and mind.
2. 
There they shunnâd the powâr of Satan
And observed celestial laws;
For in Adam-ondi-Ahman
Zion rose where Eden was.
When beyond the powâr of evil,
So that none could covet wealth,
One continual feast of blessings
Crownâd their days with peace and health.
3. 
Then the towârs of Zion glittered
Like the sun in yonder skies,
And the wicked stood and trembled,
Filled with wonder and surprise.
Then their faith and works were perfect;
Lo, they followed their great Head!
So the city went to heaven,
And the world said, âZionâs fled!â
4. 
When the Lord returns with Zion,
And we hear the watchman cry,
Then weâll surely be united,
And weâll all see eye to eye.
Then weâll mingle with the angels,
And the Lord will bless his own.
Then the earth will be as Eden,
And weâll know as we are known.
1. 
This earth was once a garden place,
With all her glories common,
And men did live a holy race,
And worship Jesus face to face,
In Adam-ondi-Ahman.
2. 
We read that Enoch walked with God,
Above the powâr of mammon,
While Zion spread herself abroad,
And Saints and angels sang aloud,
In Adam-ondi-Ahman.
3. 
Her land was good and greatly blest,
Beyond all Israelâs Canaan;
Her fame was known from east to west,
Her peace was great, and pure the rest
Of Adam-ondi-Ahman.
4. 
Hosanna to such days to come,
The Saviorâs second coming,
When all the earth in glorious bloom
Affords the Saints a holy home,
Like Adam-ondi-Ahman.
1. 
Come, thou glorious day of promise;
Come and spread thy cheerful ray,
When the scattered sheep of Israel
Shall no longer go astray,
When hosannas,
When hosannas
With united voice theyâll cry.
2. 
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry?
Shall thy wrath forever burn?
Rise, redeem thine ancient people;
Their transgressions from them turn.
King of Israel,
King of Israel,
Come and set thy people free.
3. 
Oh, that soon thou wouldst to Jacob
Thy enlivâning Spirit send!
Of their unbelief and misery
Make, O Lord, a speedy end.
Lord, Messiah!
Lord, Messiah!
Prince of Peace oâer Israel reign.
1. 
Sons of Michael, he approaches!
Rise, the ancient father greet.
Bow, ye thousands, low before him;
Minister before his feet.
Hail the patriarchâs glad reign,
Spreading over sea and main.
2. 
Sons of Michael, âtis his chariot
Rolls its burning wheels along!
Raise aloft your voices million
In a torrent powâr of song.
Hail our head with music soft!
Raise sweet melodies aloft!
3. 
Mother of our generations,
Glorious by great Michaelâs side,
Take thy childrenâs adoration;
Endless with thy seed abide.
Lo! to greet thee now advance
Thousands in the glorious dance!
4. 
Raise a chorus, sons of Michael,
Like old oceanâs roaring swell,
Till the mighty acclamation
Thru rebounding space doth tell
That the ancient one doth reign
In his Fatherâs house again!
1. 
The day dawn is breaking, the world is awaking,
The clouds of nightâs darkness are fleeing away.
The worldwide commotion, from ocean to ocean,
Now heralds the time of the beautiful day.
2. 
In many a temple the Saints will assemble
And labor as saviors of dear ones away.
Then happy reunion and sweetest communion
Weâll have with our friends in the beautiful day.
3. 
Still let us be doing, our lessons reviewing,
Which God has revealed for our walk in his way;
And then, wondrous story, the Lord in his glory
Will come in his powâr in the beautiful day.
4. 
Then pure and supernal, our friendship eternal,
With Jesus weâll live and his counsels obey
Until evâry nation will join in salvation
And worship the Lord of the beautiful day.
1. 
Let earthâs inhabitants rejoice
And gladly hail the glorious hour;
Again is heard a prophetâs voice,
And all may feel the gospelâs powâr.
2. 
The blissful time will soon arrive,
The day by holy men foretold,
When man no more with man will strive,
And all in each a friend behold.
3. 
Oppression will no more be found,
Nor tyrant hold relentless sway,
But love to God and man abound
Thruout the long millennial day.
1. 
Behold, the mountain of the Lord
In latter days shall rise
On mountaintops, above the hills,
And draw the wondâring eyes.
To this shall joyful nations come;
All tribes and tongues shall flow.
âUp to the hill of God,â theyâll say,
âAnd to his house weâll go.â
2. 
The rays that shine from Zionâs hill
Shall lighten evâry land;
The King who reigns in Salemâs towâr
Shall all the world command.
Among the nations he shall judge;
His judgments truth shall guide;
His scepter shall protect the just
And quell the sinnerâs pride.
3. 
No strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds
Disturb those peaceful years;
To plowshares men shall beat their swords,
To pruning hooks their spears.
No longer host encountâring host
Shall crowds of slain deplore;
Theyâll hang the trumpet in the hall
And study war no more.
4. 
Come, then, O house of Jacob, come,
To worship at His shrine,
And, walking in the light of God,
With holy beauties shine.
Come, then, O house of Jacob, come,
To worship at His shrine,
And, walking in the light of God,
With holy beauties shine.
1. 
Lo, the mighty God appearing!
From on high Jehovah speaks!
Eastern lands the summons hearing,
Oâer the west his thunder breaks.
Earth behold him! Earth behold him!
Universal nature shakes.
Earth behold him! Earth behold him!
Universal nature shakes.
2. 
Zion, all its light unfolding,
God in glory shall display.
Lo! he comes! nor silence holding;
Fire and clouds prepare his way.
Tempests round him! Tempests round him!
Hasten on the dreadful day.
Tempests round him! Tempests round him!
Hasten on the dreadful day.
3. 
To the heavâns his voice ascending,
To the earth beneath he cries.
Souls immortal, now descending,
Let their sleeping dust arise!
Rise to judgment! Rise to judgment!
Let thy throne adorn the skies.
Rise to judgment! Rise to judgment!
Let thy throne adorn the skies.
4. 
Now the heavâns on high adore him
And his righteousness declare.
Sinners perish from before him,
But his Saints his mercies share.
Just his judgments! Just his judgments!
God, himself the judge, is there.
Just his judgments! Just his judgments!
God, himself the judge, is there.
1. 
Softly beams the sacred dawning
Of the great millennial morn,
And to Saints gives welcome warning
That the day is hastâning on,
That the day is hastâning on.
2. 
Splendid, rising oâer the mountains,
Glowing with celestial cheer,
Streaming from eternal fountains,
Rays of living light appear,
Rays of living light appear.
3. 
Swiftly flee the clouds of darkness;
Speedily the mists retire;
Natureâs universal blackness
Is consumed by heavânly fire,
Is consumed by heavânly fire.
4. 
Yea, the fair sabbatic era,
When the world will be at rest,
Rapidly is drawing nearer;
Then all Israel will be blest,
Then all Israel will be blest.
1. 
Weâre not ashamed to own our Lord
And worship him on earth.
We love to learn his holy word
And know what souls are worth.
2. 
When Jesus comes in burning flame
To recompense the just,
The world will know the only name
In which the Saints can trust.
3. 
When he comes down from heavân to earth
With all his holy band,
Before creationâs second birth,
We hope with him to stand.
4. 
He then will give us a new name,
With robes of righteousness,
And, in the New Jerusalem,
Eternal happiness.
1. 
Come, ye children of the Lord,
Let us sing with one accord.
Let us raise a joyful strain
To our Lord who soon will reign
On this earth when it shall be
Cleansed from all iniquity,
When all men from sin will cease,
And will live in love and peace.
2. 
Oh, how joyful it will be
When our Savior we shall see!
When in splendor heâll descend,
Then all wickedness will end.
Oh, what songs we then will sing
To our Savior, Lord, and King!
Oh, what love will then bear sway
When our fears shall flee away!
3. 
All arrayed in spotless white,
We will dwell âmid truth and light.
We will sing the songs of praise;
We will shout in joyous lays.
Earth shall then be cleansed from sin.
Evâry living thing therein
Shall in love and beauty dwell;
Then with joy each heart will swell.
1. 
Come, O thou King of Kings!
Weâve waited long for thee,
With healing in thy wings,
To set thy people free.
Come, thou desire of nations, come;
Let Israel now be gathered home.
2. 
Come, make an end to sin,
And cleanse the earth by fire,
And righteousness bring in,
That Saints may tune the lyre
With songs of joy, a happier strain,
To welcome in thy peaceful reign.
3. 
Hosannas now shall sound
From all the ransomed throng,
And glory echo round
A new triumphal song;
The wide expanse of heaven fill
With anthems sweet from Zionâs hill.
4. 
Hail! Prince of life and peace!
Thrice welcome to thy throne!
While all the chosen race
Their Lord and Savior own,
The heathen nations bow the knee,
And evâry tongue sounds praise to thee.
1. 
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible, swift sword;
His truth is marching on.
2. 
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat.
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer him; be jubilant my feet!
Our God is marching on.
3. 
In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.
As he died to make men holy, let us live to make men free,
While God is marching on.
1. 
Raise your voices to the Lord,
Ye who here have heard his word.
As we part, his praise proclaim,
Shout thanksgiving to his name.
2. 
Shout thanksgiving! Let our song
Still our joy and praise prolong,
Until here we meet again
To renew the glad refrain.
1. 
All creatures of our God and King,
Lift up your voice and with us sing,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou burning sun with golden beam,
Thou silver moon with softer gleam,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
2. 
Thou rushing wind that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in heavân along,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice;
Ye light of evening, find a voice,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
3. 
Thou flowing water, pure and clear,
Make music for thy Lord to hear,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou fire so masterful and bright,
That gives to man both warmth and light,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
4. 
Dear Mother Earth, who day by day
Unfoldest blessings on our way,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
The flowârs and fruits that in thee grow,
Let them his glory also show,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
1. 
Great King of heavân, our hearts we raise
To thee in prayer, to thee in praise.
The vales exult, the hills acclaim,
And all thy works revere thy name.
2. 
O Israelâs God! Thine arm is strong.
To thee all earth and skies belong,
And with one voice in one glad chord,
With myriad echoes, praise the Lord.
1. 
On this day of joy and gladness,
Lord, we praise thy holy name;
In this sacred place of worship,
We thy glories loud proclaim!
2. 
Open wide the fount of Zion;
Let her richest blessings flow
To the Saints who nobly serve thee
In the gospel here below.
3. 
May we labor in the kingdomâ
By the prophets long foretoldâ
Where the children of the promise
Shall be gathered in the fold.
1. 
Come, all ye Saints who dwell on earth,
Your cheerful voices raise,
Our great Redeemerâs love to sing,
And celebrate his praise,
Our great Redeemerâs love to sing,
And celebrate his praise.
2. 
His love is great; he died for us.
Shall we ungrateful be,
Since he has marked a road to bliss
And said, âCome, follow me,â
Since he has marked a road to bliss
And said, âCome, follow meâ?
3. 
The straight and narrow way weâve found!
Then let us travel on,
Till we, in the celestial world,
Shall meet where Christ is gone,
Till we, in the celestial world,
Shall meet where Christ is gone.
4. 
And there weâll join the heavânly choir
And sing his praise above,
While endless ages roll around,
Perfected by his love,
While endless ages roll around,
Perfected by his love.
1. 
Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore!
Mortals, give thanks and sing
And triumph evermore.
2. 
The Lord, the Savior, reigns,
The God of truth and love.
When he had purged our stains,
He took his seat above.
3. 
His kingdom cannot fail;
He rules oâer earth and heavân.
The keys of death and hell
To Christ the Lord are givân.
1. 
Glory to God on high!
Let heavân and earth reply.
Praise ye his name.
His love and grace adore,
Who all our sorrows bore.
Sing aloud evermore:
Worthy the Lamb!
2. 
Jesus, our Lord and God,
Bore sinâs tremendous load.
Praise ye his name.
Tell what his arm has done,
What spoils from death he won.
Sing his great name alone:
Worthy the Lamb!
3. 
Let all the hosts above
Join in one song of love,
Praising his name.
To him ascribed be
Honor and majesty
Thru all eternity:
Worthy the Lamb!
A mighty fortress is our God,
A tower of strength neâer failing.
A helper mighty is our God,
Oâer ills of life prevailing.
He overcometh all.
He saveth from the Fall.
His might and powâr are great.
He all things did create.
And he shall reign for evermore.
1. 
All glory, laud, and honor
To thee, Redeemer, King,
To whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring.
Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou Davidâs royal Son,
Who in the Lordâs name comest,
The King and Blessed One.
2. 
The company of angels
Are praising thee on high,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply.
The people of the Hebrews
With palms before thee went;
Our praise and love and anthems
Before thee we present.
3. 
To thee, before thy passion,
They sang their hymns of praise;
To thee, now high exalted,
Our melody we raise.
Thou didst accept their praises;
Accept the love we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.
1. 
Sing praise to him who reigns above,
The Lord of all creation,
The source of powâr, the fount of love,
The rock of our salvation.
With healing balm my soul he fills
And evâry faithless murmur stills.
To him all praise and glory!
2. 
What his almighty powâr hath made
His gracious mercy keepeth.
By morning glow or evening shade
His watchful eye neâer sleepeth.
Within the kingdom of his might,
Lo! all is just and all is right.
To him all praise and glory!
3. 
The Lord is never far away,
But, thru all grief distressing,
An ever-present help and stay,
Our peace and joy and blessing.
As with a motherâs tender hand,
He leads his own, his chosen band.
To him all praise and glory!
4. 
Thus, all my toilsome way along
I sing aloud thy praises,
That men may hear the grateful song
My voice unwearied raises.
Be joyful in the Lord, my heart!
Both soul and body bear your part.
To him all praise and glory!
1. 
With songs of praise and gratitude
We worship God above,
In words and music give our thanks
For his redeeming love.
2. 
The Lord has said a heartfelt song
By righteous ones is prayer;
A hymn unites us and invites
The Spirit to be there.
3. 
In former days glad hymns were sung
By seed of Abraham;
The Saints shall sing, when Christ shall come,
The new song of the Lamb.
1. 
Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise him, for he is thy health and salvation!
Join the great throng,
Psaltery, organ and song,
Sounding in glad adoration!
2. 
Praise to the Lord! Over all things he gloriously reigneth.
Borne as on eagle wings, safely his Saints he sustaineth.
Hast thou not seen
How all thou needest hath been
Granted in what he ordaineth?
3. 
Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy way and defend thee.
Surely his goodness and mercy shall ever attend thee.
Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
Who with his love doth befriend thee.
4. 
Praise to the Lord! Oh, let all that is in me adore him!
All that hath breath, join with Abrahamâs seed to adore him!
Let the âamenâ
Sum all our praises again,
Now as we worship before him.
1. 
Praise the Lord with heart and voice.
Let all men on earth rejoice.
Praise to him for life and light,
Truth revealed in splendor bright!
Praise the Lord with heart and voice.
Let all men on earth rejoice.
2. 
Tell of him in loud acclaim.
Sing the wonders of his name.
Sing with joy for grace made known,
Wondrous love to all men shown.
Tell of him in loud acclaim.
Sing the wonders of his name.
3. 
Father, God, eternal Friend,
Thou art Life; there is no end.
All creation evârywhere
Lives in thee, for thou art there.
Father, God, eternal Friend,
Thou art Life; there is no end.
1. 
Praise ye the Lord! My heart shall join
In work so pleasant, so divine,
Now, while the flesh is my abode,
And when my soul ascends to God.
2. 
Praise shall employ my noblest powârs
While immortality endures;
My days of praise shall neâer be past
While life and thought and being last.
3. 
Why should I make a man my trust?
Princes must die and turn to dust.
Their breath departs; their pomp and powâr
And thoughts all vanish in an hour.
4. 
Happy the man whose hopes rely
On Israelâs God! He made the sky
And earth and seas with all their train,
And none shall find his promise vain.
5. 
His truth forever stands secure.
He saves thâoppressed; he feeds the poor;
He sends the troubled conscience peace
And grants the captive sweet release.
6. 
The Lord gives eyesight to the blind;
The Lord supports the sinking mind.
He helps the stranger in distress,
The widow, and the fatherless.
7. 
He loves the Saintsâhe knows them wellâ
But turns the wicked down to hell.
Thy God, O Zion, ever reigns;
Praise him in everlasting strains.
1. 
In hymns of praise your voices raise
To him who reigns on high,
Whose counsels keep the mighty deep,
Who ruleth earth and sky.
2. 
Beneath his hand, at his command,
The shining planets move;
To all below they daily show
His wisdom and his love.
3. 
The little flowâr that lasts an hour,
The sparrow in its fall,
They, too, shall share his tender care;
He made and loves them all.
4. 
Then sing again in lofty strain
To him who dwells on high;
To prayers you raise, and songs of praise,
He sweetly will reply.
1. 
God of our fathers, we come unto thee,
Children of those whom thy truth has made free.
Grant us the joy of thy presence today;
Never from thee let us stray!
2. 
Grateful for all that thy bounty imparts,
Praises we offer with voices and hearts.
Life of our being, and sun of our day,
Never from thee let us stray!
3. 
Blest with the gifts of the gospel of peace,
Dwelling in Zion, whose light shall increase,
Led by the priesthood along the bright way,
Never from thee will we stray!
4. 
Strengthened by thee for the conflict with sin,
Onward weâll press till lifeâs battle weâll win;
Then in thy glory forever weâll stay;
Never from thee will we stray!
1. 
Great is the Lord; âtis good to praise
His high and holy name.
Well may the Saints in latter days
His wondrous love proclaim.
2. 
The Comforter is sent again,
His powâr the Church attends,
And with the faithful will remain
Till Jesus Christ descends.
3. 
Weâll praise him for a prophetâs voice,
His peopleâs steps to guide;
In this we do and will rejoice,
Tho all the world deride.
4. 
To praise him let us all engage,
For unto us is givân
To live in this momentous age
And share the light of heavân.
1. 
God of our fathers, whose almighty hand
Leads forth in beauty all the starry band
Of shining worlds in splendor through the skies,
Our grateful songs before thy throne arise.
2. 
Thy love divine hath led us in the past;
In this free land by thee our lot is cast.
Be thou our Ruler, Guardian, Guide, and Stay,
Thy word our law, thy paths our chosen way.
3. 
From warâs alarms, from deadly pestilence,
Be thy strong arm our ever-sure defense.
Thy true religion in our hearts increase.
Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.
1. 
With all the powâr of heart and tongue,
Iâll praise my Maker in my song.
Angels shall hear the notes Iâll raise,
Approve the song, and join the praise.
2. 
Iâll sing thy truth and mercy, Lord;
Iâll sing the wonders of thy word.
Not all thy works and names below
So much thy powâr and glory show.
3. 
Amidst a thousand snares I stand,
Upheld and guided by thy hand.
Thy words my fainting soul revive
And keep my dying faith alive.
1. 
God of our fathers, known of old,
Lord of our far-flung battle line,
Beneath whose awful hand we hold
Dominion over palm and pine:
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget.
2. 
The tumult and the shouting dies;
The captains and the kings depart.
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,
An humble and a contrite heart.
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget.
3. 
Far-called, our navies melt away;
On dune and headland sinks the fire.
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget.
1. 
Press forward, Saints, with steadfast faith in Christ,
With hopeâs bright flame alight in heart and mind,
With love of God and love of all mankind.
2. 
Press forward, feasting on the word of Christ.
Receive his name, rejoicing in his might.
Come unto God; find everlasting light.
3. 
Press on, enduring in the ways of Christ.
His love proclaim thru days of mortal strife.
Thus saith our God: âYe have eternal life!â
1. 
For all the Saints who from their labors rest,
Who thee by faith before the world confessed,
Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.
2. 
Oh, may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,
â Fight as the Saints who nobly fought of old,
And win with them the victorâs crown of gold.
3. 
Thou art our rock, our fortress, and our might;
Thou, Lord, our captain in the well-fought fight;
Thou, in the darkness drear, our one true light.
4. 
And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.
5. 
From earthâs wide bounds, from oceanâs farthest coast,
Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
â Singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
1. 
Guide us, O thou great Jehovah,
Guide us to the promised land.
We are weak, but thou art able;
Hold us with thy powârful hand.
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit,
Feed us till the Savior comes,
Feed us till the Savior comes.
2. 
Open, Jesus, Zionâs fountains;
Let her richest blessings come.
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
Guard us to this holy home.
Great Redeemer, Great Redeemer,
Bring, oh, bring the welcome day,
Bring, oh, bring the welcome day!
3. 
When the earth begins to tremble,
Bid our fearful thoughts be still;
When thy judgments spread destruction,
Keep us safe on Zionâs hill,
Singing praises, Singing praises,
Songs of glory unto thee,
Songs of glory unto thee.
1. 
Faith of our fathers, living still,
In spite of dungeon, fire, and sword;
Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy
Wheneâer we hear that glorious word.
2. 
Faith of our fathers, we will strive
To win all nations unto thee,
And thru the truth that comes from God,
Mankind shall then be truly free.
3. 
Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife,
And preach thee, too, as love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life.
1. 
How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in his excellent word!
What more can he say than to you he hath said,
Who unto the Savior, who unto the Savior,
Who unto the Savior for refuge have fled?
2. 
In evâry conditionâin sickness, in health,
In povertyâs vale or abounding in wealth,
At home or abroad, on the land or the seaâ
As thy days may demand, as thy days may demand,
As thy days may demand, so thy succor shall be.
3. 
Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed,
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid.
Iâll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by my righteous, upheld by my righteous,
Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.
4. 
When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not thee oâerflow,
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
And sanctify to thee, and sanctify to thee,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.
5. 
When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply.
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume, thy dross to consume,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.
6. 
Eâen down to old age, all my people shall prove
My sovâreign, eternal, unchangeable love;
And then, when gray hair shall their temples adorn,
Like lambs shall they still, like lambs shall they still,
Like lambs shall they still in my bosom be borne.
7. 
The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose
I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
Iâll never, no never, Iâll never, no never,
Iâll never, no never, no never forsake!
1. 
Earth, with her ten thousand flowârs,
Air, with all its beams and showârs,
Heavenâs infinite expanse,
Seaâs resplendent countenanceâ
All around and all above
Bear this record: God is love.
2. 
Sounds among the vales and hills,
In the woods and by the rills,
Of the breeze and of the bird,
By the gentle murmur stirredâ
Sacred songs, beneath, above,
Have one chorus: God is love.
3. 
All the hopes that sweetly start
From the fountain of the heart,
All the bliss that ever comes
To our earthly human homes,
All the voices from above
Sweetly whisper: God is love.
1. 
Great God, attend while Zion sings
The joy that from thy presence springs.
To spend one day with thee on earth
Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.
2. 
Might I enjoy the meanest place
Within thy house, O God of grace,
No tents of ease or thrones of powâr
Should tempt my feet to leave thy door.
3. 
God is our sun; he makes our day.
God is our shield; he guards our way
From all assaults of hell and sin,
From foes without and fears within.
4. 
All needful grace will God bestow
And crown that grace with glory too.
He gives us all things and withholds
No blessings due to upright souls.
5. 
Our God, our King, whose sovereign sway
The glorious hosts of heavân obey
(And devils at thy presence flee);
Blest is the man that trusts in thee!
1. 
The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?
By day and by night his presence is near.
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;
This blessed assurance the Spirit doth bring.
2. 
The Lord is my light; tho clouds may arise,
Faith, stronger than sight, looks up thru the skies
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign.
Then how can I ever in darkness remain?
3. 
The Lord is my light; the Lord is my strength.
I know in his might Iâll conquer at length.
My weakness in mercy he covers with powâr,
And, walking by faith, I am blest evâry hour.
4. 
The Lord is my light, my all and in all.
There is in his sight no darkness at all.
He is my Redeemer, my Savior, and King.
With Saints and with angels his praises Iâll sing.
1. 
From all that dwell below the skies,
Let the Creatorâs praise arise;
Let the Redeemerâs name be sung
Through evâry land, by evâry tongue.
2. 
In evâry land begin the song;
To evâry land the strains belong.
In cheerful sounds all voices raise
And fill the world with loudest praise.
3. 
Your lofty themes, ye mortals, bring;
In songs of praise divinely sing.
The great salvation loud proclaim,
And shout for joy the Saviorâs name.
4. 
Eternal are thy mercies, Lord;
Eternal truth attends thy word.
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore,
Till suns shall rise and set no more.
1. 
Father, thy children to thee now raise
Glad, grateful songs for thy love and grace,
For thy protecting and watchful care
Over thy Saints dwelling far and near;
Grateful to thee for the gospel light,
Which with its truth fills us with delight,
Glad that weâve chosen the better part.
Songs of delight fill each grateful heart.
2. 
Oh, may our songs to thy courts ascend;
Pleasing to thee may our voices blend.
Lead us as thou hast the faithful led;
Feed us with knowledge and daily bread.
Let us not stray from the paths of truth;
Forgive the folly and faults of youth.
Father, accept thou the songs of praise
Which from our hearts unto thee we raise.
1. 
For the beauty of the earth,
For the beauty of the skies,
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies,
2. 
For the beauty of each hour
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and vale, and tree and flowâr,
Sun and moon, and stars of light,
3. 
For the joy of human love,
Brother, sister, parent, child,
Friends on earth, and friends above,
For all gentle thoughts and mild,
1. 
We gather together to ask the Lordâs blessing;
He chastens, and hastens his will to make known;
The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.
Sing praises to his name;
He forgets not his own.
2. 
Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,
Ordaining, maintaining his kingdom divine;
So from the beginning the fight we were winning;
Thou, Lord, wast at our side;
All glory be thine!
3. 
We all do extol thee, thou leader triumphant,
And pray that thou still our defender wilt be.
Let thy congregation escape tribulation;
Thy name be ever praised!
O Lord, make us free!
1. 
Come, ye thankful people, come;
Raise the song of harvest home.
All is safely gathered in
Ere the winter storms begin.
God, our Maker, doth provide
For our wants to be supplied.
Come to Godâs own temple, come;
Raise the song of harvest home.
2. 
All the world is Godâs own field,
Fruit unto his praise to yield,
Wheat and tares together sown,
Unto joy or sorrow grown.
First the blade, and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear.
Lord of harvest, grant that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.
1. 
Now thank we all our God
With hearts and hands and voices,
Who wondrous things hath done,
In whom his earth rejoices;
Who, from our mothersâ arms,
Hath blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love
And still is ours today.
2. 
Oh, may our bounteous God
Through all our life be near us,
With ever-joyful hearts
And blessed peace to cheer us,
And keep us in his love,
And guide us day and night,
And free us from all ills,
Protect us by his might.
1. 
Dearest children, God is near you,
Watching oâer you day and night,
And delights to own and bless you,
If you strive to do whatâs right.
He will bless you, He will bless you,
If you put your trust in him.
2. 
Dearest children, holy angels
Watch your actions night and day,
And they keep a faithful record
Of the good and bad you say.
Cherish virtue! Cherish virtue!
God will bless the pure in heart.
3. 
Children, God delights to teach you
By his Holy Spiritâs voice.
Quickly heed its holy promptings.
Day by day youâll then rejoice.
Oh, prove faithful, Oh, prove faithful
To your God and Zionâs cause.
1. 
Lead, kindly Light, amid thâencircling gloom;
Lead thou me on!
The night is dark, and I am far from home;
Lead thou me on!
Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
The distant sceneâone step enough for me.
2. 
I was not ever thus, nor prayâd that thou
Shouldst lead me on.
I loved to choose and see my path; but now,
Lead thou me on!
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years.
3. 
So long thy powâr hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on
Oâer moor and fen, oâer crag and torrent, till
The night is gone.
And with the morn those angel faces smile,
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile!
1. 
I need thee evâry hour,
Most gracious Lord.
No tender voice like thine
Can peace afford.
2. 
I need thee evâry hour;
Stay thou nearby.
Temptations lose their powâr
When thou art nigh.
3. 
I need thee evâry hour,
In joy or pain.
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.
4. 
I need thee evâry hour,
Most holy One.
Oh, make me thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son!
1. 
Nearer, dear Savior, to thee,
Nearer, nearer to theeâ
Ever Iâm striving to be
Nearer, yet nearer to thee!
Trusting, in thee I confide;
Hoping, in thee I abide.
2. 
Nearer, dear Savior, to thee,
Nearer, nearer to theeâ
Proved by my trials, Iâll be
Nearer, yet nearer to thee!
Humbly I come to thee now;
Earnest, I prayerfully bow.
3. 
Nearer, dear Savior, to thee,
Nearer, nearer to theeâ
Ever my anthem will be
Nearer, yet nearer to thee!
Loving thee, ever I pray,
Aid me thy will to obey.
4. 
Nearer, dear Savior, to thee,
Nearer, nearer to theeâ
Let me by holiness be
Nearer, yet nearer to thee!
When all my trials are done,
When my reward I have won,
1. 
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
Eâen though it be a cross
That raiseth me.
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
2. 
Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone,
Yet in my dreams Iâd be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
3. 
There let the way appear,
Steps unto heavân;
All that thou sendest me,
In mercy givân;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
4. 
Then with my waking thoughts
Bright with thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel Iâll raise;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
5. 
Or if, on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
1. 
Jesus, my Savior true,
Guide me to thee.
Help me thy will to do.
Guide me to thee.
Eâen in the darkest night,
As in the morning bright,
Be thou my beacon light.
Guide me to thee.
2. 
Through this dark world of strife,
Guide me to thee.
Teach me a better life.
Guide me to thee.
Let thy redeeming powâr
Be with me evâry hour.
Be thou my safety towâr.
Guide me to thee.
3. 
When strife and sin arise,
Guide me to thee.
When tears bedim my eyes,
Guide me to thee.
When hopes are crushed and dead,
When earthly joys are fled,
Thy glory round me shed.
Guide me to thee.
4. 
When silent death draws near,
Guide me to thee.
Calm thou my trembling fear.
Guide me to thee.
Let me thy mercy prove.
Let thy enduring love
Guide me to heavân above.
Guide me to thee.
1. 
Jesus, lover of my soul,
Let me to thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high.
Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past.
Safe into the haven guide;
Oh, receive my soul at last.
2. 
Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on thee.
Leave, oh, leave me not alone;
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on thee is stayed;
All my help from thee I bring.
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of thy wing.
1. 
Precious Savior, dear Redeemer,
Thy sweet message now impart.
May thy Spirit, pure and fervid,
Enter evâry timid heart;
Carry there the swift conviction,
Turning back the sinful tide.
Precious Savior, dear Redeemer,
May each soul in thee abide.
2. 
Precious Savior, dear Redeemer,
We are weak but thou art strong;
In thy infinite compassion,
Stay the tide of sin and wrong.
Keep thy loving arms around us;
Keep us in the narrow way.
Precious Savior, dear Redeemer,
Let us never from thee stray.
3. 
Precious Savior, dear Redeemer,
Thou wilt bind the broken heart.
Let not sorrow overwhelm us;
Dry the bitter tears that start.
Curb the winds and calm the billows;
Bid the angry tempest cease.
Precious Savior, dear Redeemer,
Grant us everlasting peace.
1. 
Jesus, Savior, pilot me
Over lifeâs tempestuous sea;
Unknown waves before me roll,
Hiding rock and treachârous shoal.
Chart and compass came from thee;
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
2. 
As a mother stills her child,
Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
Boistârous waves obey thy will
When thou sayâst to them, âBe still!â
Wondrous Sovâreign of the sea,
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
3. 
When at last I near the shore,
And the fearful breakers roar
âTwixt me and the peaceful rest,
Then, while leaning on thy breast,
May I hear thee say to me,
âFear not; I will pilot thee.â
1. 
Master, the tempest is raging!
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is oâershadowed with blackness.
No shelter or help is nigh.
Carest thou not that we perish?
How canst thou lie asleep
When each moment so madly is threatâning
A grave in the angry deep?
2. 
Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief today.
The depths of my sad heart are troubled.
Oh, waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep oâer my sinking soul,
And I perish! I perish! dear Master.
Oh, hasten and take control!
3. 
Master, the terror is over.
The elements sweetly rest.
Earthâs sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heavenâs within my breast.
Linger, O blessed Redeemer!
Leave me alone no more,
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor
And rest on the blissful shore.
1. 
Now to heavân our prayer ascending,
God speed the right;
In a noble cause contending,
God speed the right.
Be our zeal in heavân recorded,
With success on earth rewarded.
God speed the right.
God speed the right.
2. 
Be that prayer again repeated,
God speed the right;
Neâer despairing, though defeated,
God speed the right.
Like the great and good in story,
If we fail, we fail with glory.
God speed the right.
God speed the right.
3. 
Patient, firm, and persevering,
God speed the right;
No event nor danger fearing,
God speed the right.
Pains, nor toils, nor trials heeding,
And in heavânâs good time succeeding,
God speed the right.
God speed the right.
1. 
Lord, accept our true devotion.
Let thy Spirit whisper peace.
Swell our hearts with fond emotion,
And our joy in thee increase.
Never leave us, never leave us.
Help us, Lord, to win the race.
Never leave us, never leave us.
Help us, Lord, to win the race.
2. 
Help us all to do thy bidding,
And our daily wants supply.
Give thy Holy Spiritâs guiding
Till we reach the goal on high.
Ever guard us, ever guard us,
Till we gain the victory.
Ever guard us, ever guard us,
Till we gain the victory.
3. 
May we, with the future dawning,
Day by day from sin be free,
That on resurrection morning
We may rise at peace with thee,
Ever praising, ever praising,
Thruout all eternity;
Ever praising, ever praising,
Thruout all eternity.
1. 
The Lord is my Shepherd; no want shall I know.
I feed in green pastures; safe-folded I rest.
He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,
Restores me when wandâring, redeems when oppressed,
Restores me when wandâring, redeems when oppressed.
2. 
Thru the valley and shadow of death though I stray,
Since thou art my Guardian, no evil I fear.
Thy rod shall defend me, thy staff be my stay.
No harm can befall with my Comforter near.
No harm can befall with my Comforter near.
3. 
In the midst of affliction my table is spread.
With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth oâer.
With perfume and oil thou anointest my head.
Oh, what shall I ask of thy providence more?
Oh, what shall I ask of thy providence more?
1. 
The Lord my pasture will prepare
And feed me with a shepherdâs care.
His presence will my want supply
And guard me with a watchful eye.
My noonday walks he will attend
And all my silent midnight hours defend.
2. 
When in the sultry glebe I faint,
Or on the thirsty mountain pant,
To fertile vales and dewy meads
My weary, wandâring steps he leads,
Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
Amid the cooling verdant landscape flow.
Cast thy burden upon the Lord,
And he shall sustain thee.
He never will suffer the righteous to fall.
He is at thy right hand.
Thy mercy, Lord, is great
And far above the heavâns.
Let none be made ashamed
That wait upon thee.
1. 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.
2. 
Not the labors of my hands
Can fill all thy lawâs demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and thou alone.
3. 
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown
And behold thee on thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee.
1. 
Savior, Redeemer of my soul,
Whose mighty hand hath made me whole,
Whose wondrous powâr hath raised me up
And filled with sweet my bitter cup!
What tongue my gratitude can tell,
O gracious God of Israel.
2. 
Never can I repay thee, Lord,
But I can love thee. Thy pure word,
Hath it not been my one delight,
My joy by day, my dream by night?
Then let my lips proclaim it still,
And all my life reflect thy will.
3. 
Oâerrule mine acts to serve thine ends.
Change frowning foes to smiling friends.
Chasten my soul till I shall be
In perfect harmony with thee.
Make me more worthy of thy love,
And fit me for the life above.
1. 
Our Saviorâs love
Shines like the sun with perfect light,
As from above
It breaks thru clouds of strife.
Lighting our way,
It leads us back into his sight,
Where we may stay
To share eternal life.
2. 
The Spirit, voice
Of goodness, whispers to our hearts
A better choice
Than evilâs anguished cries.
Loud may the sound
Of hope ring till all doubt departs,
And we are bound
To him by loving ties.
3. 
Our Father, God
Of all creation, hear us pray
In revârence, awed
By thy Sonâs sacrifice.
Praises we sing.
We love thy law; we will obey.
Our heavânly King,
In thee our hearts rejoice.
1. 
I wander through the still of night,
When solitude is evârywhereâ
Alone, beneath the starry light,
And yet I know that God is there.
I kneel upon the grass and pray;
An answer comes without a voice.
It takes my burden all away
And makes my aching heart rejoice.
2. 
When I am filled with strong desire
And ask a boon of him, I see
No miracle of living fire,
But what I ask flows into me.
And when the tempest rages high
I feel no arm around me thrust,
But evâry storm goes rolling by
When I repose in him my trust.
3. 
It matters not what may befall,
What threatâning hand hangs over me;
He is my rampart through it all,
My refuge from mine enemy.
Come unto him all ye depressed,
Ye erring souls whose eyes are dim,
Ye weary ones who long for rest.
Come unto him! Come unto him!
1. 
Come, ye disconsolate, whereâer ye languish;
Come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel.
Here bring your wounded hearts; here tell your anguish.
Earth has no sorrow that heavân cannot heal.
2. 
Joy of the desolate, Light of the straying,
Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!
Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
âEarth has no sorrow that heavân cannot cure.â
3. 
Here see the Bread of Life; see waters flowing
Forth from the throne of God, pure from above.
Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing
Earth has no sorrow but heavân can remove.
1. 
âCome, follow me,â the Savior said.
Then let us in his footsteps tread,
For thus alone can we be one
With Godâs own loved, begotten Son.
2. 
âCome, follow me,â a simple phrase,
Yet truthâs sublime, effulgent rays
Are in these simple words combined
To urge, inspire the human mind.
3. 
Is it enough alone to know
That we must follow him below,
While travâling thru this vale of tears?
No, this extends to holier spheres.
4. 
Not only shall we emulate
His course while in this earthly state,
But when weâre freed from present cares,
If with our Lord we would be heirs.
5. 
We must the onward path pursue
As wider fields expand to view,
And follow him unceasingly,
Whateâer our lot or sphere may be.
6. 
For thrones, dominions, kingdoms, powârs,
And glory great and bliss are ours,
If we, throughout eternity,
Obey his words, âCome, follow me.â
1. 
Come unto Jesus, ye heavy laden,
Careworn and fainting, by sin oppressed.
Heâll safely guide you unto that haven
Where all who trust him may rest.
2. 
Come unto Jesus; Heâll ever heed you,
Though in the darkness youâve gone astray.
His love will find you and gently lead you
From darkest night into day.
3. 
Come unto Jesus; Heâll surely hear you,
If you in meekness plead for his love.
Oh, know you not that angels are near you
From brightest mansions above?
4. 
Come unto Jesus from evâry nation,
From evâry land and isle of the sea.
Unto the high and lowly in station,
Ever he calls, âCome to me.â
1. 
Ye simple souls who stray
Far from the path of peace,
That lonely, unfrequented way
To life and happiness,
Why will ye folly love,
And throng the downward road,
And hate the wisdom from above,
And mock the sons of God?
2. 
Madness and misery
Ye count our life beneath,
And nothing great or good can see
Or glorious in our death.
But thru the Holy Ghost
We witness better things,
For he whose blood is all our boast
Has made us priests and kings.
3. 
Riches unsearchable
In Jesusâ love we know,
And pleasures springing from the well
Of life our souls oâerflow.
As we seek heavânly bliss,
Angels our steps attend,
And God himself our Father is,
And Jesus is our Friend.
4. 
With him we walk in white;
We in his image shine;
Our robes are robes of glorious light,
Our righteousness divine.
On all the kings of earth
With pity we look down
And claim, in virtue of our birth,
A never-fading crown.
1. 
Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known.
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And worship at his throne.
2. 
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God,
But servants of the heavânly King
May speak their joys abroad.
3. 
The God who rules on high
And all the earth surveysâ
Who rides upon the stormy sky
And calms the roaring seasâ
4. 
This mighty God is ours,
Our Father and our Love.
He will send down his heavânly powârs
To carry us above.
1. 
Lean on my ample arm,
O thou depressed!
And I will bid the storm
Cease in thy breast.
Whateâer thy lot may be
On lifeâs complaining sea,
If thou wilt come to me,
Thou shalt have rest.
If thou wilt come to me,
Thou shalt have rest.
2. 
Lift up thy tearful eyes,
Sad heart, to me;
I am the sacrifice
Offered for thee.
In me thy pain shall cease,
In me is thy release,
In me thou shalt have peace
Eternally.
In me thou shalt have peace
Eternally.
1. 
Iâm a pilgrim, Iâm a stranger
Cast upon the rocky shore
Of a land where deathly danger
Surges with a sullen roar,
Oft despairing, oft despairing,
Lest I reach my home no more.
2. 
Misty vapors rise before me.
Scarcely can I see the way.
Clouds of darkest hue hang oâer me,
And Iâm apt to go astray
With the many, with the many
That are now the vultureâs prey.
3. 
O my Father, I entreat thee,
Let me see thy beckâning hand;
And when straying, may I meet thee
Ere I join the silent band.
Guide me, Father, guide me, Father,
Safely to the promised land.
1. 
Though deepâning trials throng your way,
Press on, press on, ye Saints of God!
Ere long the resurrection day
Will spread its life and truth abroad,
Will spread its life and truth abroad.
2. 
Though outward ills await us here,
The time, at longest, is not long
Ere Jesus Christ will reappear,
Surrounded by a glorious throng,
Surrounded by a glorious throng.
3. 
Lift up your hearts in praise to God;
Let your rejoicings never cease.
Though tribulations rage abroad,
Christ says, âIn me ye shall have peace.â
Christ says, âIn me ye shall have peace.â
4. 
What though our rights have been assailed?
What though by foes weâve been despoiled?
Jehovahâs promise has not failed;
Jehovahâs purpose is not foiled.
Jehovahâs purpose is not foiled.
5. 
This work is moving on apace,
And great events are rolling forth;
The kingdom of the latter days,
The âlittle stone,â must fill the earth.
The âlittle stone,â must fill the earth.
6. 
Though Satan rage, âtis all in vain;
The words the ancient prophet spoke
Sure as the throne of God remain;
Nor men nor devils can revoke.
Nor men nor devils can revoke.
7. 
All glory to his holy name
Who sends his faithful servants forth
To prove the nations, to proclaim
Salvationâs tidings through the earth.
Salvationâs tidings through the earth.
1. 
Oh, may my soul commune with thee
And find thy holy peace;
From worldly care and pain of fear,
Please bring me sweet release.
2. 
Oh, bless me when I worship thee
To keep my heart in tune,
That I may hear thy still, small voice,
And, Lord, with thee commune.
3. 
Enfold me in thy quiet hour
And gently guide my mind
To seek thy will, to know thy ways,
And thy sweet Spirit find.
4. 
Lord, grant me thy abiding love
And make my turmoil cease.
Oh, may my soul commune with thee
And find thy holy peace.
1. 
Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side;
With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain.
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In evâry change he faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heavânly Friend
Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.
2. 
Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as he has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below.
3. 
Be still, my soul: The hour is hastâning on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, loveâs purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
1. 
How gentle Godâs commands!
How kind his precepts are!
Come, cast your burdens on the Lord
And trust his constant care.
2. 
Beneath his watchful eye,
His Saints securely dwell;
That hand which bears all nature up
Shall guard his children well.
3. 
Why should this anxious load
Press down your weary mind?
Haste to your Heavânly Fatherâs throne
And sweet refreshment find.
4. 
His goodness stands approved,
Unchanged from day to day;
Iâll drop my burden at his feet
And bear a song away.
1. 
How long, O Lord most holy and true,
Shall shadowed hope our joy delay?
Our hearts confess, our souls believe
Thy truth, thy truth, thy light, thy will, thy way!
2. 
Thy truth has made our prison bright;
Thy light has dimmed the dying past.
We bend beneath thy loving will
And seek thy onward, onward path at last.
3. 
Eternal Father, gentle Judge!
Speed on the day, redemptionâs hour.
Set up thy kingdom; from thy house
Unlock for us, for us the prison towâr.
4. 
From grim confusionâs awful depth
The wail of hosts, faithâs urgent plea:
Release our anguished, weary souls;
Swing wide, swing wide the gates, and set us free!
1. 
Does the journey seem long,
The path rugged and steep?
Are there briars and thorns on the way?
Do sharp stones cut your feet
As you struggle to rise
To the heights thru the heat of the day?
2. 
Is your heart faint and sad,
Your soul weary within,
As you toil âneath your burden of care?
Does the load heavy seem
You are forced now to lift?
Is there no one your burden to share?
3. 
Let your heart be not faint
Now the journeyâs begun;
There is One who still beckons to you.
So look upward in joy
And take hold of his hand;
He will lead you to heights that are newâ
4. 
A land holy and pure,
Where all trouble doth end,
And your life shall be free from all sin,
Where no tears shall be shed,
For no sorrows remain.
Take his hand and with him enter in.
I will not doubt, I will not fear;
Godâs love and strength are always near.
His promised gift helps me to find
An inner strength and peace of mind.
I give the Father willingly
My trust, my prayers, humility.
His Spirit guides; his love assures
That fear departs when faith endures.
1. 
Where can I turn for peace?
Where is my solace
When other sources cease to make me whole?
When with a wounded heart, anger, or malice,
I draw myself apart,
Searching my soul?
2. 
Where, when my aching grows,
Where, when I languish,
Where, in my need to know, where can I run?
Where is the quiet hand to calm my anguish?
Who, who can understand?
He, only One.
3. 
He answers privately,
Reaches my reaching
In my Gethsemane, Savior and Friend.
Gentle the peace he finds for my beseeching.
Constant he is and kind,
Love without end.
1. 
Be thou humble in thy weakness, and the Lord thy God shall lead thee,
Shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers.
Be thou humble in thy pleading, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee,
Shall bless thee with a sweet and calm assurance that he cares.
2. 
Be thou humble in thy calling, and the Lord thy God shall teach thee
To serve his children gladly with a pure and gentle love.
Be thou humble in thy longing, and the Lord thy God shall take thee,
Shall take thee home at last to ever dwell with him above.
1. 
More holiness give me,
More strivings within,
More patience in suffâring,
More sorrow for sin,
More faith in my Savior,
More sense of his care,
More joy in his service,
More purpose in prayer.
2. 
More gratitude give me,
More trust in the Lord,
More pride in his glory,
More hope in his word,
More tears for his sorrows,
More pain at his grief,
More meekness in trial,
More praise for relief.
3. 
More purity give me,
More strength to oâercome,
More freedom from earth-stains,
More longing for home.
More fit for the kingdom,
More used would I be,
More blessed and holyâ
More, Savior, like thee.
1. 
God is in his holy temple.
Earthly thoughts, be silent now,
While with revârence we assemble
And before his presence bow.
He is with us, now and ever,
When we call upon his name,
Aiding evâry good endeavor,
Guiding evâry upward aim.
2. 
God is in his holy temple,
In the pure and holy mind,
In the revârent heart and simple,
In the soul from sin refined.
Banish then each base emotion.
Lift us up, O Lord, to thee;
Let our souls, in pure devotion,
Temples for thy worship be.
1. 
Father in Heaven, in thy love abounding,
Hear these thy children thru the world resounding,
Loud in thy praises. Thanks for peace abiding,
Ever abiding.
2. 
Filled be our hearts with peace beyond comparing,
Peace in thy world, and joy to hearts despairing.
Firm is our trust in thee for peace enduring,
Ever enduring.
3. 
God of our fathers, strengthen evâry nation
In thy great peace, where only is salvation.
So may the world its future spread before thee,
Thus to adore thee.
1. 
I believe in Christ; he is my King!
With all my heart to him Iâll sing;
Iâll raise my voice in praise and joy,
In grand amens my tongue employ.
I believe in Christ; he is Godâs Son.
On earth to dwell his soul did come.
He healed the sick; the dead he raised.
Good works were his; his name be praised.
2. 
I believe in Christ; oh blessed name!
As Maryâs Son he came to reign
âMid mortal men, his earthly kin,
To save them from the woes of sin.
I believe in Christ, who marked the path,
Who did gain all his Father hath,
Who said to men: âCome, follow me,
That ye, my friends, with God may be.â
3. 
I believe in Christâmy Lord, my God!
My feet he plants on gospel sod.
Iâll worship him with all my might;
He is the source of truth and light.
I believe in Christ; he ransoms me.
From Satanâs grasp he sets me free,
And I shall live with joy and love
In his eternal courts above.
4. 
I believe in Christ; he stands supreme!
From him Iâll gain my fondest dream;
And while I strive through grief and pain,
His voice is heard: âYe shall obtain.â
I believe in Christ; so come what may,
With him Iâll stand in that great day
When on this earth he comes again
To rule among the sons of men.
1. 
I know that my Redeemer lives,
Triumphant Savior, Son of God,
Victorious over pain and death,
My King, my Leader, and my Lord.
2. 
He lives, my one sure rock of faith,
The one bright hope of men on earth,
The beacon to a better way,
The light beyond the veil of death.
3. 
Oh, give me thy sweet Spirit still,
The peace that comes alone from thee,
The faith to walk the lonely road
That leads to thine eternity.
1. 
I know that my Redeemer lives.
What comfort this sweet sentence gives!
He lives, he lives, who once was dead.
He lives, my ever-living Head.
He lives to bless me with his love.
He lives to plead for me above.
He lives my hungry soul to feed.
He lives to bless in time of need.
2. 
He lives to grant me rich supply.
He lives to guide me with his eye.
He lives to comfort me when faint.
He lives to hear my soulâs complaint.
He lives to silence all my fears.
He lives to wipe away my tears.
He lives to calm my troubled heart.
He lives all blessings to impart.
3. 
He lives, my kind, wise heavânly Friend.
He lives and loves me to the end.
He lives, and while he lives, Iâll sing.
He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King.
He lives and grants me daily breath.
He lives, and I shall conquer death.
He lives my mansion to prepare.
He lives to bring me safely there.
4. 
He lives! All glory to his name!
He lives, my Savior, still the same.
Oh, sweet the joy this sentence gives:
âI know that my Redeemer lives!â
He lives! All glory to his name!
He lives, my Savior, still the same.
Oh, sweet the joy this sentence gives:
âI know that my Redeemer lives!â
1. 
The witness of the Holy Ghost,
As borne by those who know,
Has lifted me again to thee,
O Father of my soul.
2. 
I know that thou art in the heavân.
I know the Savior reigns.
I know a prophet speaks to us
For our eternal gain.
3. 
My eyes are wet; my heart is full.
The Spirit speaks today.
O Lord, wilt thou my life renew
And in my bosom stay.
4. 
As testimony fills my heart,
It dulls the pain of days.
For one brief moment, heavenâs view
Appears before my gaze.
1. 
On bended knees, with broken hearts,
We come before thee, Lord,
In secret and in open prayerâ
Oh, wilt thou speak thy word?
2. 
Weâve shared our bread with those in need,
Relieved the suffâring poor.
The stranger we have welcomed inâ
Wilt thou impart thy store?
3. 
As witnesses, we gather here
To thank, and to attest
Of mercies and of miraclesâ
Oh, still our lives so bless!
1. 
In fasting we approach thee here
And pray thy Spirit from above
Will cleanse our hearts, cast out our fear,
And fill our hunger with thy love.
2. 
Thru this small sacrifice, may we
Recall that strength and life each day
Are sacred blessings sent from theeâ
Fill us with gratitude, we pray.
3. 
And may our fast fill us with care
For all thy children now in need.
May we from our abundance share,
Thy sheep to bless, thy lambs to feed.
4. 
This fast, dear Father, sanctifyâ
Our faith and trust in thee increase.
As we commune and testify,
May we be filled with joy and peace.
1. 
Ere you left your room this morning,
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ, our Savior,
Did you sue for loving favor
As a shield today?
2. 
When your heart was filled with anger,
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way?
3. 
When sore trials came upon you,
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was full of sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates of day?
1. 
Jesus, the very thought of thee
With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far thy face to see
And in thy presence rest.
2. 
Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memâry find
A sweeter sound than thy blest name,
O Savior of mankind!
3. 
O hope of evâry contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who fall, how kind thou art!
How good to those who seek!
4. 
Jesus, our only joy be thou,
As thou our prize wilt be;
Jesus, be thou our glory now,
And thru eternity.
1. 
Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of prayer!
That calls me from a world of care
And bids me at my Fatherâs throne
Make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief
And oft escaped the tempterâs snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!
And oft escaped the tempterâs snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!
2. 
Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of prayer!
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless.
And since he bids me seek his face,
Believe his word, and trust his grace,
Iâll cast on him my evâry care
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!
Iâll cast on him my evâry care
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!
1. 
Let the Holy Spirit guide;
Let him teach us what is true.
He will testify of Christ,
Light our minds with heavenâs view.
2. 
Let the Holy Spirit guard;
Let his whisper govern choice.
He will lead us safely home
If we listen to his voice.
3. 
Let the Spirit heal our hearts
Thru his quiet, gentle powâr.
May we purify our lives
To receive him hour by hour.
1. 
There is an hour of peace and rest,
Unmarred by earthly care;
âTis when before the Lord I go
And kneel in secret prayer.
2. 
The straight and narrow way to heavân,
Where angels bright and fair
Are singing to Godâs praise, is found
Thru constant secret prayer.
3. 
When sailing on lifeâs stormy sea,
âMid billows of despair,
âTis solace to my soul to know
God hears my secret prayer.
4. 
When thorns are strewn along my path,
And foes my feet ensnare,
My Savior to my aid will come,
If sought in secret prayer.
1. 
Prayer is the soulâs sincere desire,
Uttered or unexpressed,
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast.
2. 
Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
The falling of a tear,
The upward glancing of an eye
When none but God is near.
3. 
Prayer is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try;
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach
The Majesty on high.
4. 
Prayer is the Christianâs vital breath,
The Christianâs native air,
His watchword at the gates of death;
He enters heavân with prayer.
5. 
Prayer is the contrite sinnerâs voice,
Returning from his ways,
While angels in their songs rejoice
And cry, âBehold, he prays!â
6. 
The Saints in prayer appear as one
In word and deed and mind,
While with the Father and the Son
Their fellowship they find.
7. 
Nor prayer is made on earth alone:
The Holy Spirit pleads,
And Jesus at the Fatherâs throne
For sinners intercedes.
8. 
O thou by whom we come to God,
The Life, the Truth, the Way!
The path of prayer thyself hast trod;
Lord, teach us how to pray.
1. 
Gently raise the sacred strain,
For the Sabbathâs come again
That man may rest,
That man may rest,
And return his thanks to God
For his blessings to the blest,
For his blessings to the blest.
2. 
Holy day, devoid of strifeâ
Let us seek eternal life,
That great reward,
That great reward,
And partake the sacrament
In remembrance of our Lord,
In remembrance of our Lord.
3. 
Sweetly swells the solemn sound
While we bring our gifts around
Of broken hearts,
Of broken hearts,
As a willing sacrifice,
Showing what his grace imparts,
Showing what his grace imparts.
4. 
Holy, holy is the Lord.
Precious, precious is his word:
Repent and live,
Repent and live;
Tho your sins be crimson red,
Oh, repent, and heâll forgive.
Oh, repent, and heâll forgive.
1. 
Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
To praise thy name, give thanks and sing,
To show thy love by morning light,
And talk of all thy truths at night.
2. 
Sweet is the day of sacred rest.
No mortal care shall seize my breast.
Oh, may my heart in tune be found,
Like Davidâs harp of solemn sound!
3. 
My heart shall triumph in my Lord
And bless his works and bless his word.
Thy works of grace, how bright they shine!
How deep thy counsels, how divine!
4. 
But, oh, what triumph shall I raise
To thy dear name through endless days,
When in the realms of joy I see
Thy face in full felicity!
5. 
Sin, my worst enemy before,
Shall vex my eyes and ears no more.
My inward foes shall all be slain,
Nor Satan break my peace again.
6. 
Then shall I see and hear and know
All I desired and wished below,
And every powâr find sweet employ
In that eternal world of joy.
1. 
In sweet remembrance of thy Son,
We gather in thy house as one
To join in prayer, to sing thy praise,
To worship thee and learn thy ways.
Father, on this the Sabbath day,
Be with us gathered here, we pray.
2. 
And may our thoughts still turn to thee,
With loved ones, friends, and family.
In all we do till day is gone,
May worship still continue on.
Father, on this the Sabbath day,
Be with us in our homes, we pray.
3. 
Help each to seek a quiet hour
To read thy word and feel thy powâr,
To hear thy voice, though small and still,
Renew our strength to do thy will.
Father, on this the Sabbath day,
Be with us in our hearts, we pray.
1. 
As the dew from heavân distilling
Gently on the grass descends
And revives it, thus fulfilling
What thy providence intends,
2. 
Let thy doctrine, Lord, so gracious,
Thus descending from above,
Blest by thee, prove efficacious
To fulfill thy work of love.
3. 
Lord, behold this congregation;
Precious promises fulfill.
From thy holy habitation
Let the dews of life distill.
4. 
Let our cry come up before thee.
Thy sweet Spirit shed around,
So the people shall adore thee
And confess the joyful sound.
1. 
O thou kind and gracious Father,
Reigning in the heavâns above,
Look on us, thy humble children;
Fill us with thy holy love.
Fill us with thy holy love.
2. 
We have met this Sabbath morning,
Words of life and truth to hear.
Teach us how to ever serve thee
And thy holy name revere,
And thy holy name revere.
3. 
Help us to resist temptation;
Help us to refrain from ill.
Help us all to gain salvation;
Help us all to do thy will.
Help us all to do thy will.
1. 
We meet, dear Lord, in meekness all,
Responding to thy Sabbath call
To gather here in thy blest name,
And pledge our faithfulness again.
2. 
Thy counsels true we love to hear,
And feel thy Spiritâs presence near,
As we with friends our voices raise
In prayer and songs of joyous praise.
3. 
In oneness and in love we come
Once more to this our Sabbath home,
Rejoicing in thy welcome here,
Unto this place of peace and prayer.
1. 
God be with you till we meet again;
By his counsels guide, uphold you;
With his sheep securely fold you.
God be with you till we meet again.
2. 
God be with you till we meet again;
When lifeâs perils thick confound you,
Put his arms unfailing round you.
God be with you till we meet again.
3. 
God be with you till we meet again;
Keep loveâs banner floating oâer you;
Smite deathâs threatâning wave before you.
God be with you till we meet again.
1. 
Lord, we ask thee ere we part,
Bless the teachings of this day.
Plant them deep in evâry heart,
That with us theyâll ever stay.
2. 
In the innocence of youth,
We would all thy laws fulfill.
Lead us in the way of truth.
Give us strength to do thy will.
3. 
Father, merciful and kind,
While we labor for the right,
May we in thy service find
Sweetest pleasure, pure delight.
4. 
All our follies, Lord, forgive.
Keep us from temptations free.
Help us evermore to live
Lives of holiness to thee.
Father, this hour has been one of joy;
We thank thee for thy many blessings.
Our hearts are filled with thy gracious love
And thy tender caring.
1. 
We have partaken of thy love,
O Lord, this sacred hour;
We have renewed our covenants
And felt thy cleansing powâr,
And felt thy cleansing powâr.
2. 
Let us go forth refreshed, resolved
To serve our fellowmen,
Forgive our neighbors, live thy word,
Until we come again,
Until we come again.
3. 
Raising to thee in song and word
Our praise, most holy One,
We ask thy benediction, Lord,
Thru thy Beloved Son,
Thru thy Beloved Son.
1. 
Sing we now at parting
One more strain of praise.
To our Heavânly Father
Sweetest songs weâll raise.
For his loving kindness,
For his tender care,
Let our songs of gladness
Fill this Sabbath air.
2. 
Praise him for his mercy;
Praise him for his love.
For unnumbered blessings
Praise the Lord above.
Let our happy voices
Still the notes prolong.
One alone is worthy
Of our sweetest song.
3. 
Jesus, our Redeemer,
Now our praises hear.
While we bow before thee,
Lend a listâning ear.
Save us, Lord, from error.
Watch us day by day.
Help us now to serve thee
In a pleasing way.
1. 
Thy Spirit, Lord, has stirred our souls,
And by its inward shining glow
We see anew our sacred goals
And feel thy nearness here below.
No burning bush near Sinai
Could show thy presence, Lord, more nigh.
2. 
âDid not our hearts within us burn?â
We know the Spiritâs fire is here.
It makes our souls for service yearn;
It makes the path of duty clear.
Lord, may it prompt us, day by day,
In all we do, in all we say.
1. 
Before thee, Lord, I bow my head
And thank thee for what has been said.
My soul vibrates; my poor heart sings
When thy sweet Spirit strikes the strings.
How sweet thy word Iâve heard this day!
Be thou my guide, O Lord, I pray.
May I in patience do my part.
Seal thou the word upon my heart.
2. 
Do thou, O Lord, anoint mine eyes
That I may see and win the prize.
My heart is full; mine eyes are wet.
Oh, help me, Lord, lest I forget.
So may my soul be filled with light
That I may see and win the fight,
And then at last exalted be,
In peace and rest, O Lord, with thee.
3. 
Look up, my soul; be not cast down.
Keep not thine eyes upon the ground.
Break off the shackles of the earth.
Receive, my soul, the spiritâs birth.
And now as I go forth again
To mingle with my fellowmen,
Stay thou nearby, my steps to guide,
That I may in thy love abide.
1. 
Now the day is over;
Night is drawing nigh;
Shadows of the evening
Steal across the sky.
2. 
Jesus, give the weary
Calm and sweet repose;
With thy tendârest blessing
May our eyelids close.
Softly now the light of day
Fades upon my sight away.
Free from care, from labor free,
Lord, I would commune with thee.
1. 
The Lord be with us as we walk
Along our homeward road.
In silent thought or friendly talk,
Our hearts be near to God.
In silent thought or friendly talk,
Our hearts be near to God.
2. 
The Lord be with us till the night
Enfold our day of rest,
And be in evâry heart the light,
In evâry home the guest.
And be in evâry heart the light,
In evâry home the guest.
3. 
The Lord be with us thru the hours
Of slumber calm and deep,
Protect our homes, renew our powârs,
And guard us as we sleep.
Protect our homes, renew our powârs,
And guard us as we sleep.
1. 
Lord, we come before thee now;
At thy feet we humbly bow.
Do not thou our suit disdain;
Shall we seek thee, Lord, in vain?
2. 
In thine own appointed way,
Now we seek thee; here we stay.
Lord, from hence we would not go,
Till a blessing thou bestow.
3. 
Send some message from thy word
That may joy and peace afford.
Comfort those who weep and mourn;
Let the time of love return.
4. 
Grant we all may seek and find
Thee, our gracious God, and kind.
Heal the sick; the captive free.
Let us all rejoice in thee.
1. 
Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing;
Fill our hearts with joy and peace.
Let us each, thy love possessing,
Triumph in redeeming grace.
Oh, refresh us, oh, refresh us,
Travâling thru this wilderness.
Oh, refresh us, oh, refresh us,
Travâling thru this wilderness.
2. 
Thanks we give and adoration
For the gospelâs joyful sound.
May the fruits of thy salvation
In our hearts and lives abound.
Ever faithful, ever faithful
To the truth may we be found.
Ever faithful, ever faithful
To the truth may we be found.
1. 
Great God, to thee my evening song
With humble gratitude I raise;
Oh, let thy mercy tune my tongue
And fill my heart with lively praise.
2. 
My days, unclouded as they pass,
And evâry onward rolling hour
Are monuments of wondrous grace
And witness to thy love and powâr.
3. 
With hope in thee mine eyelids close;
With sleep refresh my feeble frame.
Safe in thy care may I repose
And wake with praises to thy name.
1. 
Abide with me; âtis eventide.
The day is past and gone;
The shadows of the evening fall;
The night is coming on.
Within my heart a welcome guest,
Within my home abide.
2. 
Abide with me; âtis eventide.
Thy walk today with me
Has made my heart within me burn,
As I communed with thee.
Thy earnest words have filled my soul
And kept me near thy side.
3. 
Abide with me; âtis eventide,
And lone will be the night
If I cannot commune with thee
Nor find in thee my light.
The darkness of the world, I fear,
Would in my home abide.
1. 
Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens. Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!
2. 
Swift to its close ebbs out lifeâs little day.
Earthâs joys grow dim; its glories pass away.
Change and decay in all around I see;
O thou who changest not, abide with me!
3. 
I need thy presence evâry passing hour.
What but thy grace can foil the tempterâs powâr?
Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Thru cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me!
1. 
Come, let us sing an evening hymn
To calm our minds for rest,
And each one try, with single eye,
To praise the Savior best.
2. 
Yea, let us sing a sacred song
To close the passing day,
With one accord call on the Lord
And ever watch and pray.
3. 
Oh, thank the Lord for grace and gifts
Renewed in latter days,
For truth and light to guide us right
In wisdomâs pleasant ways,
4. 
For evâry line we have received
To turn our hearts above,
For evâry word and evâry good
That fill our souls with love.
5. 
Oh, let us raise a holier strain
For blessings great as ours,
And be prepared while angels guard
Us through our slumbâring hours.
6. 
Oh, may we sleep and wake in joy,
While life with us remains,
And then go home beyond the tomb,
Where peace forever reigns.
1. 
As the shadows fall, O Savior,
Turn our thoughts and minds to thee.
Help us, Lord, that we may strive for
Peace, and find our rest in thee.
2. 
Father, please watch oâer our loved ones
As the evening round them flows.
Lord, accept our supplications;
Be with us in our repose.
1. 
As now we take the sacrament,
Our thoughts are turned to thee,
Thou Son of God, who lived for us,
Then died on Calvary.
We contemplate thy lasting grace,
Thy boundless charity;
To us the gift of life was givân
For all eternity.
2. 
As now our minds review the past,
We know we must repent;
The way to thee is righteousnessâ
The way thy life was spent.
Forgiveness is a gift from thee
We seek with pure intent.
With hands now pledged to do thy work,
We take the sacrament.
3. 
As now we praise thy name with song,
The blessings of this day
Will linger in our thankful hearts,
And silently we pray
For courage to accept thy will,
To listen and obey.
We love thee, Lord; our hearts are full.
Weâll walk thy chosen way.
1. 
God, our Father, hear us pray;
Send thy grace this holy day.
As we take of emblems blest,
On our Saviorâs love we rest.
2. 
Grant us, Father, grace divine;
May thy smile upon us shine.
As we eat the broken bread,
Thine approval on us shed.
3. 
As we drink the water clear,
Let thy Spirit linger near.
Pardon faults, O Lord, we pray;
Bless our efforts day by day.
1. 
With humble heart, I bow my head
And think of thee, O Savior, Lord.
I take the water and the bread
To show remembrance of thy word.
2. 
Help me remember, I implore,
Thou gavâst thy life on Calvary,
That I might live forevermore
And grow, dear Lord, to be like thee.
3. 
To be like thee! I lift my eyes
From earth below toward heavân above,
That I may learn from vaulted skies
How I my worthiness can prove.
4. 
As I walk daily here on earth,
Give me thy Spirit as I seek
A change of heart, another birth,
And grow, dear Lord, to be like thee.
1. 
In humility, our Savior,
Grant thy Spirit here, we pray,
As we bless the bread and water
In thy name this holy day.
Let me not forget, O Savior,
Thou didst bleed and die for me
When thy heart was stilled and broken
On the cross at Calvary.
2. 
Fill our hearts with sweet forgiving;
Teach us tolerance and love.
Let our prayers find access to thee
In thy holy courts above.
Then, when we have proven worthy
Of thy sacrifice divine,
Lord, let us regain thy presence;
Let thy glory round us shine.
1. 
While of these emblems we partake
In Jesusâ name and for his sake,
Let us remember and be sure
Our hearts and hands are clean and pure.
2. 
For us the blood of Christ was shed;
For us on Calvaryâs cross he bled,
And thus dispelled the awful gloom
That else were this creationâs doom.
3. 
The law was broken; Jesus died
That justice might be satisfied,
That man might not remain a slave
Of death, of hell, or of the grave,
4. 
But rise triumphant from the tomb,
And in eternal splendor bloom,
Freed from the powâr of death and pain,
With Christ, the Lord, to rule and reign.

1. 
O God, thâEternal Father,
Who dwells amid the sky,
In Jesusâ name we ask thee
To bless and sanctify,
If we are pure before thee,
This bread and cup of wine,
That we may all remember
That offering divineâ
2. 
That sacred, holy offâring,
By man least understood,
To have our sins remitted
And take his flesh and blood,
That we may ever witness
The suffâring of thy Son,
And always have his Spirit
To make our hearts as one.
3. 
When Jesus, the Anointed,
Descended from above
And gave himself a ransom
To win our souls with loveâ
With no apparent beauty,
That man should him desireâ
He was the promised Savior,
To purify with fire.
4. 
How infinite that wisdom,
The plan of holiness,
That made salvation perfect
And veiled the Lord in flesh,
To walk upon his footstool
And be like man, almost,
In his exalted station,
And die, or all was lost.
1. 
âTis sweet to sing the matchless love
Of Him who left his home above
And came to earthâoh, wondrous planâ
To suffer, bleed, and die for man!
2. 
âTis good to meet each Sabbath day
And, in his own appointed way,
Partake the emblems of his death,
And thus renew our love and faith.
3. 
Oh, blessed hour! communion sweet!
When children, friends, and teachers meet
And, in remembrance of his grace,
Unite in sweetest songs of praise.
4. 
For Jesus died on Calvary!
That all thru him might ransomed be.
Then sing hosannas to his name;
Let heavân and earth his love proclaim.
1. 
âTis sweet to sing the matchless love
Of Him who left his home above
And came to earthâoh, wondrous planâ
To suffer, bleed, and die for man!
2. 
âTis good to meet each Sabbath day
And, in his own appointed way,
Partake the emblems of his death,
And thus renew our love and faith.
3. 
Oh, blessed hour! communion sweet!
When children, friends, and teachers meet
And, in remembrance of his grace,
Unite in sweetest songs of praise.
1. 
O Lord of Hosts, we now invoke
Thy Spirit most divine
To cleanse our hearts while we partake
The broken bread and wine.
2. 
May we forever think of thee
And of thy suffârings sore,
Endured for us on Calvary,
And praise thee evermore.
3. 
Prepare our minds that we may see
The beauties of thy grace,
Salvation purchased on that tree
For all who seek thy face.
4. 
As brethren, let us ever live
In fellowship and peace!
Forgive, that God may us forgive,
That love may still increase.
5. 
May union, peace, and love abound,
And perfect harmony,
And joy in one continual round
Through all eternity.
1. 
Again, our dear redeeming Lord,
We meet in thy beloved name,
While from the fountains of thy love
Thy Spirit kindles like a flame.
For all the anguish of thy soul,
For thy great gift so full and free,
With grateful hearts all penitent,
Dear Lord, we do remember thee.
2. 
In token of thy bleeding flesh
And of thy blood so freely spent,
We meet around thy table now
And take thy holy sacrament.
We seek thy pardon, dearest Lord,
And may thy favor, too, be sent,
While in our hearts we turn to thee,
Renewed in faith and covenant.
1. 
Father in Heavân, we do believe
The promise thou hast made;
Thy word with meekness we receive,
Just as thy Saints have said.
2. 
We now repent of all our sin
And come with broken heart,
And to thy covenant enter in
And choose the better part.
3. 
O Lord, accept us while we pray,
And all our sins forgive;
New life impart to us this day,
And bid the sinners live.
4. 
Humbly we take the sacrament
In Jesusâ blessed name;
Let us receive thru covenant
The Spiritâs heavânly flame.
5. 
We will be buried in the stream
In Jesusâ blessed name,
And rise, while light shall on us beam
The Spiritâs heavânly flame.
6. 
Baptize us with the Holy Ghost
And seal us as thine own,
That we may join the ransomed host
And with the Saints be one.
1. 
Jesus of Nazareth,
Savior and King!
Triumphant over death,
Life thou didst bring,
Leaving thy Fatherâs throne,
On earth to live,
Thy work to do alone,
Thy life to give.
2. 
While of this broken bread
Humbly we eat,
Our thoughts to thee are led
In revârence sweet.
Bruised, broken, torn for us
On Calvaryâs hillâ
Thy suffâring borne for us
Lives with us still.
3. 
As to our lips the cup
Gently we press,
Our hearts are lifted up;
Thy name we bless!
Guide us whereâer we go,
Till in the end
Life evermore weâll know
Through thee, our Friend.
1. 
Weâll sing all hail to Jesusâ name,
And praise and honor give
To him who bled on Calvaryâs hill
And died that we might live.
2. 
He passed the portals of the grave;
Salvation was his song;
He called upon the sinbound soul
To join the heavânly throng.
3. 
He seized the keys of death and hell
And bruised the serpentâs head;
He bid the prison doors unfold,
The grave yield up her dead.
4. 
The bread and water represent
His sacrifice for sin;
Ye Saints, partake and testify
Ye do remember him.
1. 
In remembrance of thy suffâring,
Lord, these emblems we partake,
When thyself thou gavâst an offâring,
Dying for the sinnerâs sake.
Weâve forgiven as thou biddest
All whoâve trespassed against us.
Lord, forgive, as weâve forgiven,
All thou seest amiss in us.
2. 
Purify our hearts, our Savior;
Let us go not far astray,
That we may be counted worthy
Of thy Spirit day by day.
When temptations are before us,
Give us strength to overcome.
Always guard us in our wandârings
Till we leave our earthly home.
3. 
When thou comest in thy glory
To this earth to rule and reign,
And with faithful ones partakest
Of the bread and wine again,
May we be among the number
Worthy to surround the board,
And partake anew the emblems
Of the suffârings of our Lord.
1. 
Upon the cross of Calvary
They crucified our Lord
And sealed with blood the sacrifice
That sanctified his word.
2. 
Upon the cross he meekly died
For all mankind to see
That death unlocks the passageway
Into eternity.
3. 
Upon the cross our Savior died,
But, dying, brought new birth
Through resurrectionâs miracle
To all the sons of earth.
1. 
Revârently and meekly now,
Let thy head most humbly bow.
Think of me, thou ransomed one;
Think what I for thee have done.
With my blood that dripped like rain,
Sweat in agony of pain,
With my body on the tree
I have ransomed even thee.
2. 
In this bread now blest for thee,
Emblem of my body see;
In this water or this wine,
Emblem of my blood divine.
Oh, remember what was done
That the sinner might be won.
On the cross of Calvary
I have suffered death for thee.
3. 
Bid thine heart all strife to cease;
With thy brethren be at peace.
Oh, forgive as thou wouldst be
Eâen forgiven now by me.
In the solemn faith of prayer
Cast upon me all thy care,
And my Spiritâs grace shall be
Like a fountain unto thee.
4. 
At the throne I intercede;
For thee ever do I plead.
I have loved thee as thy friend,
With a love that cannot end.
Be obedient, I implore,
Prayerful, watchful evermore,
And be constant unto me,
That thy Savior I may be.
1. 
Again we meet around the board
Of Jesus, our redeeming Lord,
With faith in his atoning blood,
Our only access unto God.
2. 
He left his Fatherâs courts on high,
With man to live, for man to die,
A world to purchase and to save
And seal a triumph oâer the grave.
3. 
Help us, O God, to realize
The great atoning sacrifice,
The gift of thy beloved Son,
The Prince of Life, the Holy One.
4. 
Oh, bless us, Lord, for Jesusâ sake,
That we may worthily partake
These emblems of the flesh and blood
Of our Redeemer, Savior, God.
1. 
God loved us, so he sent his Son,
Christ Jesus, the atoning One,
To show us by the path he trod
The one and only way to God.
2. 
He came as man, though Son of God,
And bowed himself beneath the rod.
He died in holy innocence,
A broken law to recompense.
3. 
Oh, love effulgent, love divine!
What debt of gratitude is mine,
That in his offâring I have part
And hold a place within his heart.
4. 
In word and deed he doth require
My will to his, like son to sire,
Be made to bend, and I, as son,
Learn conduct from the Holy One.
5. 
This sacrament doth represent
His blood and body for me spent.
Partaking now is deed for word
That I remember him, my Lord.
1. 
When in the wondrous realms above
Our Savior had been called upon
To save our world of sin by love,
He said, âThy will, O Lord, be done.â
2. 
The King of Kings left worlds of light,
Became the meek and lowly One;
In brightest day or darkest night,
He said, âThy will, O Lord, be done.â
3. 
No crown of thorns, no cruel cross
Could make our great Redeemer shun.
He counted his own will but naught,
And said, âThy will, O Lord, be done.â
4. 
We take the bread and cup this day
In memâry of the sinless One,
And pray for strength, that we may say,
As he, âThy will, O Lord, be done.â
1. 
O thou, before the world began,
Ordained a sacrifice for man,
And by thâeternal Spirit made
An offâring in the sinnerâs stead;
Our everlasting Priest art thou,
Pleading thy death for sinners now.
2. 
Thy offâring still continues new
Before the righteous Fatherâs view.
Thyself the Lamb forever slain;
Thy priesthood doth unchanged remain.
Thy years, O God, can never fail,
Nor thy blest work within the veil.
3. 
Oh, that our faith may never move
But stand unshaken as thy love,
Sure evidence of things unseen;
Now let it pass the years between
And view thee bleeding on the tree:
My Lord, my God, who dies for me.
1. 
In memâry of the Crucified,
Our Father, we have met this hour.
May thy sweet Spirit here abide,
That all may feel its glowing powâr.
2. 
Our Savior, in Gethsemane,
Shrank not to drink the bitter cup,
And then, for us, on Calvary,
Upon the cross was lifted up.
3. 
We revârence with the broken bread,
Together with the cup we take,
The body bruised, the lifeblood shed,
A sinless ransom for our sake.
4. 
Our Father, may this sacrament
To evâry soul be sanctified
Who eats and drinks with pure intent,
That in our Savior heâll abide.
1. 
Behold the great Redeemer die,
A broken law to satisfy.
He dies a sacrifice for sin,
He dies a sacrifice for sin,
That man may live and glory win.
2. 
While guilty men his pains deride,
They pierce his hands and feet and side;
And with insulting scoffs and scorns,
And with insulting scoffs and scorns,
They crown his head with plaited thorns.
3. 
Although in agony he hung,
No murmâring word escaped his tongue.
His high commission to fulfill,
His high commission to fulfill,
He magnified his Fatherâs will.
4. 
âFather, from me remove this cup.
Yet, if thou wilt, Iâll drink it up.
Iâve done the work thou gavest me,
Iâve done the work thou gavest me;
Receive my spirit unto thee.â
5. 
He died, and at the awful sight
The sun in shame withdrew its light!
Earth trembled, and all nature sighed,
Earth trembled, and all nature sighed
In dread response, âA God has died!â
6. 
He livesâhe lives. We humbly now
Around these sacred symbols bow
And seek, as Saints of latter days,
And seek, as Saints of latter days,
To do his will and live his praise.
1. 
He died! The great Redeemer died,
And Israelâs daughters wept around.
A solemn darkness veiled the sky;
A sudden trembling shook the ground.
2. 
Come, Saints, and drop a tear or two
For him who groaned beneath your load;
He shed a thousand drops for you,
A thousand drops of precious blood.
3. 
Hereâs love and grief beyond degree;
The Lord of glory died for men.
But lo! what sudden joys were heard!
The Lord, though dead, revived again.
4. 
The rising Lord forsook the tomb.
In vain the tomb forbade him rise.
Cherubic legions guard him home
And shout him welcome to the skies.
1. 
I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me.
I tremble to know that for me he was crucified,
That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.
2. 
I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine,
That he should extend his great love unto such as I,
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.
3. 
I think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!
Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
No, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
Until at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.
1. 
There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.
2. 
We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains he had to bear,
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.
3. 
There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin.
He only could unlock the gate
Of heavân and let us in.
4. 
Oh, dearly, dearly has he loved!
And we must love him too,
And trust in his redeeming blood,
And try his works to do.
1. 
How great the wisdom and the love
That filled the courts on high
And sent the Savior from above
To suffer, bleed, and die!
2. 
His precious blood he freely spilt;
His life he freely gave,
A sinless sacrifice for guilt,
A dying world to save.
3. 
By strict obedience Jesus won
The prize with glory rife:
âThy will, O God, not mine be done,â
Adorned his mortal life.
4. 
He marked the path and led the way,
And evâry point defines
To light and life and endless day
Where Godâs full presence shines.
5. 
In memâry of the broken flesh
We eat the broken bread
And witness with the cup, afresh,
Our faith in Christ, our Head.
6. 
How great, how glorious, how complete
Redemptionâs grand design,
Where justice, love, and mercy meet
In harmony divine!
1. 
Jesus, once of humble birth,
Now in glory comes to earth.
Once he suffered grief and pain;
Now he comes on earth to reign.
Now he comes on earth to reign.
2. 
Once a meek and lowly Lamb,
Now the Lord, the great I Am.
Once upon the cross he bowed;
Now his chariot is the cloud.
Now his chariot is the cloud.
3. 
Once he groaned in blood and tears;
Now in glory he appears.
Once rejected by his own,
Now their King he shall be known.
Now their King he shall be known.
4. 
Once forsaken, left alone,
Now exalted to a throne.
Once all things he meekly bore,
But he now will bear no more.
But he now will bear no more.
1. 
O Savior, thou who wearest
A crown of piercing thorn,
The pain thou meekly bearest,
Weighâd down by grief and scorn.
The soldiers mock and flail thee;
For drink they give thee gall;
Upon the cross they nail thee
To die, O King of all.
2. 
No creature is so lowly,
No sinner so depraved,
But feels thy presence holy
And thru thy love is saved.
Tho craven friends betray thee,
They feel thy loveâs embrace;
The very foes who slay thee
Have access to thy grace.
3. 
Thy sacrifice transcended
The mortal lawâs demand;
Thy mercy is extended
To evâry time and land.
No more can Satan harm us,
Tho long the fight may be,
Nor fear of death alarm us;
We live, O Lord, thru thee.
4. 
What praises can we offer
To thank thee, Lord most high?
In our place thou didst suffer;
In our place thou didst die,
By heavenâs plan appointed,
To ransom us, our King.
O Jesus, the anointed,
To thee our love we bring!
1. 
That Easter morn, a grave that burst
Proclaimed to man that âLast and Firstâ
Had risân again
And conquered pain.
2. 
This morn renews for us that day
When Jesus cast the bonds away,
Took living breath
And conquered death.
3. 
Thus we in gratitude recall
And give our love and pledge our all,
Shed grateful tear
And conquer fear.
1. 
He is risen! He is risen!
Tell it out with joyful voice.
He has burst his three daysâ prison;
Let the whole wide earth rejoice.
Death is conquered; man is free.
Christ has won the victory.
2. 
Come with high and holy hymning;
Chant our Lordâs triumphant lay.
Not one darksome cloud is dimming
Yonder glorious morning ray,
Breaking oâer the purple east,
Symbol of our Easter feast.
3. 
He is risen! He is risen!
He hath opened heavenâs gate.
We are free from sinâs dark prison,
Risen to a holier state.
And a brighter Easter beam
On our longing eyes shall stream.
1. 
Christ the Lord is risân today,Â Alleluia!
Sons of men and angels say,Â Alleluia!
Raise your joys and triumphs high,Â Alleluia!
Sing, ye heavâns, and earth reply,Â Alleluia!
2. 
Loveâs redeeming work is done,Â Alleluia!
Fought the fight, the victâry won,Â Alleluia!
Jesusâ agony is oâer,Â Alleluia!
Darkness veils the earth no more,Â Alleluia!
3. 
Lives again our glorious King,Â Alleluia!
Where, O death, is now thy sting?Â Alleluia!
Once he died our souls to save,Â Alleluia!
Where thy victory, O grave?Â Alleluia!
1. 
Joy to the world, the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King!
Let evâry heart prepare him room,
And Saints and angels sing,
And Saints and angels sing,
And Saints, and Saints and angels sing.
2. 
Rejoice! Rejoice when Jesus reigns,
And Saints their songs employ,
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
3. 
No more will sin and sorrow grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
Heâll come and make the blessings flow
Far as the curse was found,
Far as the curse was found,
Far as, far as the curse was found.
4. 
Rejoice! Rejoice in the Most High,
While Israel spreads abroad
Like stars that glitter in the sky,
And ever worship God,
And ever worship God,
And ever, and ever worship God.
1. 
Oh, come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant!
Oh, come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold him,
Born the King of angels;
2. 
â Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation;
âÂ Sing, all ye citizens of heavân above!
Glory to God,
Glory in the highest;
3. 
â Yea, Lord, we greet thee,
Born this happy morning;
âÂ Jesus, to thee be all glory givân.
Son of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing;
1. 
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing oâer the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.
2. 
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavânly song?
3. 
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
1. 
Silent night! Holy night!
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and Child.
Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace;
Sleep in heavenly peace.
2. 
Silent night! Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight!
Glories stream from heaven afar;
Heavânly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Savior, is born!
Christ, the Savior, is born!
3. 
Silent night! Holy night!
Son of God, loveâs pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth;
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.
1. 
Once in royal Davidâs city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for his bed:
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.
2. 
He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And his shelter was a stable,
And his cradle was a stall;
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
Lived on earth our Savior holy.
3. 
And our eyes at last shall see him,
Through his own redeeming love;
For that child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heavân above,
And he leads his children on
To the place where he is gone.
1. 
Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head;
The stars in the heavens looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.
2. 
The cattle are lowing; the poor baby wakes,
But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.
3. 
Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven to live with thee there.
1. 
It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
âPeace on the earth, good will to men
From heavânâs all-gracious King.â
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.
2. 
Still thru the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavânly music floats
Oâer all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovâring wing,
And ever oâer its babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.
3. 
For lo! the days are hastâning on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heavân and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace their King,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.
1. 
O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie.
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light.
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.
2. 
For Christ is born of Mary,
And, gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondâring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth,
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.
3. 
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is givân!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heavân.
No ear may hear his coming;
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.
1. 
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!
Joyful, all ye nations, rise;
Join the triumph of the skies;
With thâangelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem!
2. 
Hail the heavân-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings,
Risân with healing in his wings.
Mild he lays his glory by,
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
1. 
With wondâring awe the wisemen saw
The star in heaven springing,
And with delight, in peaceful night,
They heard the angels singing:
2. 
By light of star they traveled far
To seek the lowly manger,
A humble bed wherein was laid
The wondrous little Stranger.
3. 
And still is found, the world around,
The old and hallowed story,
And still is sung in evâry tongue
The angelsâ song of glory:
4. 
The heavânly star its rays afar
On evâry land is throwing,
And shall not cease till holy peace
In all the earth is growing.
1. 
While shepherds watchâd their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around.
âFear not,â said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind;
âGlad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.â
2. 
âTo you, in Davidâs town this day,
Is born of Davidâs line
The Savior who is Christ the Lord,
And this shall be the sign:
The heavânly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
And in a manger laid.â
3. 
Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God, who thus
Addressed their joyful song:
âAll glory be to God on high
And on the earth be peace.
Goodwill henceforth from heavân to men
Begin and never cease.â
1. 
Far, far away on Judeaâs plains,
Shepherds of old heard the joyous strains:
2. 
Sweet are these strains of redeeming love,
Message of mercy from heavân above:
3. 
Lord, with the angels we too would rejoice;
Help us to sing with the heart and voice:
4. 
Hasten the time when, from evâry clime,
Men shall unite in the strains sublime:
1. 
The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winterâs night that was so deep.
2. 
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
1. 
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
2. 
I thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along thâunbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
3. 
And in despair I bowed my head:
âThere is no peace on earth,â I said,
âFor hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.â
4. 
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
âGod is not dead, nor doth he sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With peace on earth, good will to men.â
5. 
Till, ringing, singing, on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,
Of peace on earth, good will to men!
1. 
Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light.
The year is dying in the night;
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
The year is dying in the night;
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
2. 
Ring out the old; ring in the new.
Ring, happy bells, across the snow.
The year is going; let him go.
Ring out the false; ring in the true.
The year is going; let him go.
Ring out the false; ring in the true.
3. 
Ring in the valiant men and free,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand.
Ring out the darkness of the land;
Ring in the Christ that is to be.
Ring out the darkness of the land;
Ring in the Christ that is to be.
1. 
We are sowing, daily sowing
Countless seeds of good and ill,
Scattered on the level lowland,
Cast upon the windy hill;
Seeds that sink in rich, brown furrows,
Soft with heavenâs gracious rain;
Seeds that rest upon the surface
Of the dry, unyielding plain;
2. 
Seeds that fall amid the stillness
Of the lonely mountain glen;
Seeds cast out in crowded places,
Trodden under foot of men;
Seeds by idle hearts forgotten,
Flung at random on the air;
Seeds by faithful souls remembered,
Sown in tears and love and prayer;
3. 
Seeds that lie unchanged, unquickened,
Lifeless on the teeming mold;
Seeds that live and grow and flourish
When the sowerâs hand is cold.
By a whisper sow we blessings;
By a breath we scatter strife.
In our words and thoughts and actions
Lie the seeds of death and life.
4. 
Thou who knowest all our weakness,
Leave us not to sow alone!
Bid thine angels guard the furrows
Where the precious grain is sown,
Till the fields are crownâd with glory,
Filled with mellow, ripened ears,
Filled with fruit of life eternal
From the seed we sowed in tears.
1. 
Come, let us anew our journey pursue,
Roll round with the year,
And never stand still till the Master appear.
His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,
And our talents improve
By the patience of hope and the labor of love,
By the patience of hope and the labor of love.
2. 
Our life as a dream, our time as a stream
Glide swiftly away,
And the fugitive moment refuses to stay;
For the arrow is flown and the moments are gone.
The millennial year
Presses on to our view, and eternityâs here,
Presses on to our view, and eternityâs here.
3. 
Oh, that each in the day of His coming may say,
âI have fought my way thru;
I have finished the work thou didst give me to do.â
Oh, that each from his Lord may receive the glad word:
âWell and faithfully done;
Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne;
Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne.â
1. 
We give thee but thine own,
Whateâer the gift may be,
For all we have is thine alone,
A trust, O Lord, from thee.
2. 
May we thy bounties thus
As stewards true receive,
And gladly, as thou blessest us,
To thee our firstfruits give.
3. 
To comfort and to bless,
To find a balm for woe,
To tend the lone and fatherless
Is angelsâ work below.
4. 
And we believe thy word,
Tho dim our faith may be;
Whateâer we do for thine, O Lord,
We do it unto thee.
1. 
Savior, may I learn to love thee,
Walk the path that thou hast shown,
Pause to help and lift another,
Finding strength beyond my own.
Savior, may I learn to love theeâ
Lord, I would follow thee.
2. 
Who am I to judge another
When I walk imperfectly?
In the quiet heart is hidden
Sorrow that the eye canât see.
Who am I to judge another?
Lord, I would follow thee.
3. 
I would be my brotherâs keeper;
I would learn the healerâs art.
To the wounded and the weary
I would show a gentle heart.
I would be my brotherâs keeperâ
Lord, I would follow thee.
4. 
Savior, may I love my brother
As I know thou lovest me,
Find in thee my strength, my beacon,
For thy servant I would be.
Savior, may I love my brotherâ
Lord, I would follow thee.
1. 
Dear to the heart of the Shepherd,
Dear are the sheep of his fold;
Dear is the love that he gives them,
Dearer than silver or gold.
Dear to the heart of the Shepherd,
Dear are his âotherâ lost sheep;
Over the mountains he follows,
Over the waters so deep.
2. 
Dear to the heart of the Shepherd,
Dear are the lambs of his fold;
Some from the pastures are straying,
Hungry and helpless and cold.
See, the Good Shepherd is seeking,
Seeking the lambs that are lost,
Bringing them in with rejoicing,
Saved at such infinite cost.
3. 
Dear to the heart of the Shepherd,
Dear are the âninety and nineâ;
Dear are the sheep that have wandered
Out in the desert to pine.
Hark! he is earnestly calling,
Tenderly pleading today:
âWill you not seek for my lost ones,
Off from my shelter astray?â
4. 
Green are the pastures inviting;
Sweet are the waters and still.
Lord, we will answer thee gladly,
âYes, blessed Master, we will!
Make us thy true under-shepherds;
Give us a love that is deep.
Send us out into the desert,
Seeking thy wandering sheep.â
1. 
Hear thou our hymn, O Lord,
With thankful hearts we pray.
Help us thy will to follow now,
And walk the narrow way.
2. 
Keep thou our hearts aglow
With thy eternal word.
Give us thy Spirit evâry hour,
We ask thee, gracious Lord.
1. 
Have I done any good in the world today?
Have I helped anyone in need?
Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?
If not, I have failed indeed.
Has anyoneâs burden been lighter today
Because I was willing to share?
Have the sick and the weary been helped on their way?
When they needed my help was I there?
2. 
There are chances for work all around just now,
Opportunities right in our way.
Do not let them pass by, saying, âSometime Iâll try,â
But go and do something today.
âTis noble of man to work and to give;
Loveâs labor has merit alone.
Only he who does something helps others to live.
To God each good work will be known.
1. 
I have work enough to do,
Ere the sun goes down,
For myself and kindred too,
Ere the sun goes down:
Evâry idle whisper stilling
With a purpose firm and willing,
All my daily tasks fulfilling,
Ere the sun goes down.
2. 
I must speak the loving word,
Ere the sun goes down.
I must let my voice be heard,
Ere the sun goes down:
Evâry cry of pity heeding,
For the injured interceding,
To the light the lost ones leading,
Ere the sun goes down.
3. 
As I journey on my way,
Ere the sun goes down,
Godâs commands I must obey,
Ere the sun goes down.
There are sins that need confessing;
There are wrongs that need redressing
If I would obtain the blessing,
Ere the sun goes down.
1. 
We are marching on to glory;
We are working for our crown.
We will make our armor brighter
And never lay it down.
2. 
Then day by day we are marching;
To heaven we are bound.
Each good act brings us nearer
That home where weâll be crowned.
3. 
Then, with the ransomed children
That throng the starry throne,
We will praise our Lord and Savior,
His powâr and mercy own.
1. 
Improve the shining moments;
Donât let them pass you by.
Work while the sun is radiant;
Work, for the night draws nigh.
We cannot bid the sunbeams
To lengthen out their stay,
Nor can we ask the shadow
To ever stay away.
2. 
Time flies on wings of lightning;
We cannot call it back.
It comes, then passes forward
Along its onward track.
And if we are not mindful,
The chance will fade away,
For life is quick in passing.
âTis as a single day.
3. 
As wintertime doth follow
The pleasant summer days,
So may our joys all vanish
And pass far from our gaze.
Then should we not endeavor
Each day some point to gain,
That we may here be useful
And evâry wrong disdain?
4. 
Improve each shining moment.
In this you are secure,
For promptness bringeth safety
And blessings rich and pure.
Let prudence guide your actions;
Be honest in your heart;
And God will love and bless you
And help to you impart.
1. 
There is sunshine in my soul today,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my light.
2. 
There is music in my soul today,
A carol to my King,
And Jesus listening can hear
The songs I cannot sing.
3. 
There is springtime in my soul today,
For when the Lord is near,
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
The flowârs of grace appear.
4. 
There is gladness in my soul today,
And hope and praise and love,
For blessings which he gives me now,
For joys âlaid upâ above.
1. 
You can make the pathway bright,
Fill the soul with heavenâs light,
If thereâs sunshine in your heart;
Turning darkness into day,
As the shadows fly away,
If thereâs sunshine in your heart today.
2. 
You can speak the gentle word
To the heart with anger stirred,
If thereâs sunshine in your heart;
Tho it seems a little thing,
It will heavenâs blessings bring,
If thereâs sunshine in your heart today.
3. 
You can do a kindly deed
To your neighbor in his need,
If thereâs sunshine in your heart;
And his burden you will share
As you lift his load of care,
If thereâs sunshine in your heart today.
4. 
You can live a happy life
In this world of toil and strife,
If thereâs sunshine in your heart;
And your soul will glow with love
From the perfect Light above,
If thereâs sunshine in your heart today.
1. 
Today, while the sun shines, work with a will;
Today all your duties with patience fulfill.
Today, while the birds sing, harbor no care;
Call life a good gift; call the world fair.
2. 
Today seek the treasure better than gold,
The peace and the joy that are found in the fold.
Today seek the gems that shine in the heart;
While here we labor, choose the better part.
3. 
Today seek for goodness, virtue, and truth,
As crown of your life and the grace of your youth.
Today, while the heart beats, live to be true,
Constant and faithful all the way through.
1. 
In a world where sorrow
Ever will be known,
Where are found the needy
And the sad and lone,
How much joy and comfort
You can all bestow,
If you scatter sunshine
Evârywhere you go.
2. 
Slightest actions often
Meet the sorest needs,
For the world wants daily
Little kindly deeds.
Oh, what care and sorrow
You may help remove,
With your songs and courage,
Sympathy and love.
3. 
When the days are gloomy,
Sing some happy song;
Meet the worldâs repining
With a courage strong.
Go with faith undaunted
Thru the ills of life;
Scatter smiles and sunshine
Oâer its toil and strife.
1. 
Father, cheer our souls tonight;
Lift our burdens, make them light.
Let thine all-pervading love
Shine upon us from above.
2. 
Calm the surges of the soul;
Bid the dark waves backward roll.
Let us all thy mercies feel
Thru the powâr thou dost reveal.
3. 
Bless our loved ones far away;
Grant them health and peace, we pray.
In their hearts let holy light
Beam to guide their steps aright.
4. 
Let implicit faith and trust
Help us know thy ways are just.
May thine ever-tender love
Lead our hearts to thee above.
1. 
Let us oft speak kind words to each other
At home or whereâer we may be;
Like the warblings of birds on the heather,
The tones will be welcome and free.
Theyâll gladden the heart thatâs repining,
Give courage and hope from above,
And where the dark clouds hide the shining,
Let in the bright sunlight of love.
2. 
Like the sunbeams of morn on the mountains,
The soul they awake to good cheer;
Like the murmur of cool, pleasant fountains,
They fall in sweet cadences near.
Letâs oft, then, in kindly toned voices,
Our mutual friendship renew,
Till heart meets with heart and rejoices
In friendship that ever is true.
1. 
Nay, speak no ill; a kindly word
Can never leave a sting behind;
And, oh, to breathe each tale weâve heard
Is far beneath a noble mind.
Full oft a better seed is sown
By choosing thus the kinder plan,
For, if but little good is known,
Still let us speak the best we can.
2. 
Give me the heart that fain would hide,
Would fain anotherâs faults efface.
How can it please the human pride
To prove humanity but base?
No, let us reach a higher mood,
A nobler estimate of man;
Be earnest in the search for good,
And speak of all the best we can.
3. 
Then speak no ill, but lenient be
To othersâ failings as your own.
If youâre the first a fault to see,
Be not the first to make it known,
For life is but a passing day;
No lip may tell how brief its span.
Then, oh, the little time we stay,
Letâs speak of all the best we can.
1. 
Jesus, mighty King in Zion,
Thou alone our guide shalt be.
Thy commission we rely on;
We will follow none but thee.
2. 
As an emblem of thy passion
And thy victâry oâer the grave,
We, who know thy great salvation,
Are baptized beneath the wave.
3. 
Fearless of the worldâs despising,
We the ancient path pursue,
Buried with the Lord and rising
To a life divinely new.
1. 
Should you feel inclined to censure
Faults you may in others view,
Ask your own heart, ere you venture,
If you have not failings, too.
Let not friendly vows be broken;
Rather strive a friend to gain.
Many words in anger spoken
Find their passage home again.
2. 
Do not, then, in idle pleasure
Trifle with a brotherâs fame;
Guard it as a valued treasure,
Sacred as your own good name.
Do not form opinions blindly;
Hastiness to trouble tends;
Those of whom we thought unkindly
Oft become our warmest friends.
1. 
Lord, accept into thy kingdom
Each repentant, humbled one,
Born of water and the Spirit
In thy name, Beloved Son.
Let the Holy Ghost, descending,
Comfort, guide the path of youth,
Channel of all light and glory,
Key to vision, knowledge, truth.
2. 
Know ye not that he was holy?
Yet he witnessed unto men
That the way is straight and narrow
Leading unto God again.
Hark, glad tidings of salvation.
Hear his word, âCome, follow me
Unto glory in my kingdom,
Unto life eternally.â
3. 
Like the sound of rushing waters
In this day his word is said:
Holy ordinance of mercy
For the living and the dead!
Let your hearts rejoice in gladness!
Let the earth break forth and sing!
Let the dead speak praising anthems
To our God, eternal King!
1. 
Do what is right; the day-dawn is breaking,
Hailing a future of freedom and light.
Angels above us are silent notes taking
Of evâry action; then do what is right!
2. 
Do what is right; the shackles are falling.
Chains of the bondsmen no longer are bright;
Lightened by hope, soon theyâll cease to be galling.
Truth goeth onward; then do what is right!
3. 
Do what is right; be faithful and fearless.
Onward, press onward, the goal is in sight.
Eyes that are wet now, ere long will be tearless.
Blessings await you in doing whatâs right!
1. 
Behold thy sons and daughters, Lord,
On whom we lay our hands.
They have fulfilled the gospel word
And bowed at thy commands.
2. 
Oh, now send down the heavânly dove
And overwhelm their souls
With peace and joy and perfect love,
As lambs within thy fold.
3. 
Seal them by thine own Spiritâs powâr,
Which purifies from sin,
And may they find, from this good hour,
They are adopted in.
4. 
Increase their faith, confirm their hope,
And guide them in the way.
With comfort bear their spirits up
Until the perfect day.
1. 
Choose the right when a choice is placed before you.
In the right the Holy Spirit guides;
And its light is forever shining oâer you,
When in the right your heart confides.
2. 
Choose the right! Let no spirit of digression
Overcome you in the evil hour.
Thereâs the right and the wrong to evâry question;
Be safe thru inspirationâs powâr.
3. 
Choose the right! There is peace in righteous doing.
Choose the right! Thereâs safety for the soul.
Choose the right in all labors youâre pursuing;
Let God and heaven be your goal.
1. 
Know this, that evâry soul is free
To choose his life and what heâll be;
For this eternal truth is givân:
That God will force no man to heavân.
2. 
Heâll call, persuade, direct aright,
And bless with wisdom, love, and light,
In nameless ways be good and kind,
But never force the human mind.
3. 
Freedom and reason make us men;
Take these away, what are we then?
Mere animals, and just as well
The beasts may think of heavân or hell.
4. 
May we no more our powârs abuse,
But ways of truth and goodness choose;
Our God is pleased when we improve
His grace and seek his perfect love.
1. 
When upon lifeâs billows you are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings; name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.
2. 
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings; evâry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.
3. 
When you look at others with their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you his wealth untold.
Count your many blessings; money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven nor your home on high.
4. 
So amid the conflict, whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged; God is over all.
Count your many blessings; angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you to your journeyâs end.
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise him, all creatures here below;
Praise him above, ye heavânly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
1. 
Let us all press on in the work of the Lord,
That when life is oâer we may gain a reward;
In the fight for right let us wield a sword,
The mighty sword of truth.
2. 
We will not retreat, though our numbers may be few
When compared with the opposite host in view;
But an unseen powâr will aid me and you
In the glorious cause of truth.
3. 
If we do whatâs right we have no need to fear,
For the Lord, our helper, will ever be near;
In the days of trial his Saints he will cheer,
And prosper the cause of truth.
1. 
âCome along, come alongâ is the call that will win,
To lead us to virtue and keep us from sin;
Most men can be led, but few can be drivân
In shunning perdition and striving for heavân.
2. 
âCome to me, come to meâ sweetly falls on the ear,
The word of the Lord full of comfort and cheer,
To bind up the broken, the captive set free,
In the good time thatâs coming, we hope soon to see.
3. 
Let us govern by kindness and never by force,
All cheering and bright, like the sun in its course;
Obedience will spring from each heart with a bound,
And brotherhood flourish the wide world around.
1. 
This house we dedicate to thee,
Our God, our fathersâ God.
Wilt thou accept and deign to bless
The path our feet have trod?
2. 
Wilt thou thy servants here inspire
When in thy name they speak?
And wilt thou bless each contrite soul
Who here thy face doth seek?
3. 
Here may our sons and daughters come
And find that peace which swells
From grateful hearts, when touched by thee,
Wherein thy Spirit dwells!
1. 
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ, the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See his banners go!
2. 
At the sign of triumph
Satanâs host doth flee;
On, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory.
Hellâs foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.
3. 
Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
Where the Saints have trod.
We are not divided;
All one body we:
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.
4. 
Onward, then, ye people;
Join our happy throng.
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song:
Glory, laud, and honor
Unto Christ, the King.
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing.
1. 
We love thy house, O God,
Wherein thine honor dwells.
The joy of thine abode
All earthly joy excels.
2. 
It is the house of prayer,
Wherein thy servants meet,
And thou, O Lord, art there,
Thy chosen flock to greet.
3. 
We love the word of life,
The word that tells of peace,
Of comfort in the strife,
Of joys that never cease.
1. 
Up, awake, ye defenders of Zion!
The foeâs at the door of your homes;
Let each heart be the heart of a lion,
Unyielding and proud as he roams.
Remember the trials of Missouri;
Forget not the courage of Nauvoo.
When the enemy host is before you,
Stand firm and be faithful and true.
Stand firm and be faithful and true,
Stand firm and be faithful and true;
When the enemy host is before you,
Stand firm and be faithful and true.
2. 
By His power is Zion surrounded;
Her warriors are noble and brave,
And their faith on Jehovah is founded,
Whose power is mighty to save.
In each soldier a brave heart is beating,
Tho our numbers, compared, may be few.
Weâll not rest till our foes are retreating,
And weâll always be faithful and true.
And weâll always be faithful and true,
And weâll always be faithful and true;
Weâll not rest till our foes are retreating,
And weâll always be faithful and true.
3. 
Tho, assisted by legions infernal,
The plundering foemen advance,
With a host from the regions eternal
Weâll scatter their troops at a glance.
Soon the kingdom will be independent;
In wonder the nations will view
Our Zion in glory resplendent;
Then let us be faithful and true.
Then let us be faithful and true,
Then let us be faithful and true;
Our Zion in glory resplendent;
Then let us be faithful and true.
1. 
Called to serve Him, heavânly King of glory,
Chosen eâer to witness for his name,
Far and wide we tell the Fatherâs story,
Far and wide his love proclaim.
2. 
Called to know the richness of his blessingâ
Sons and daughters, children of a Kingâ
Glad of heart, his holy name confessing,
Praises unto him we bring.
1. 
We are all enlisted till the conflict is oâer;
Happy are we! Happy are we!
Soldiers in the army, thereâs a bright crown in store;
We shall win and wear it by and by.
Haste to the battle, quick to the field;
Truth is our helmet, buckler, and shield.
Stand by our colors; proudly they wave!
Weâre joyfully, joyfully marching to our home.
2. 
Hark! the sound of battle sounding loudly and clear;
Come join the ranks! Come join the ranks!
We are waiting now for soldiers; whoâll volunteer?
Rally round the standard of the cross.
Hark! âtis our Captain calls you today;
Lose not a moment, make no delay!
Fight for our Savior; come, come away!
Weâre joyfully, joyfully marching to our home.
3. 
Fighting for a kingdom, and the world is our foe;
Happy are we! Happy are we!
Glad to join the army, we will sing as we go;
We shall gain the victâry by and by.
Dangers may gatherâwhy should we fear?
Jesus, our Leader, ever is near.
He will protect us, comfort, and cheer.
Weâre joyfully, joyfully marching to our home.
1. 
Behold! A royal army,
With banner, sword, and shield,
Is marching forth to conquer
On lifeâs great battlefield.
Its ranks are filled with soldiers,
United, bold, and strong,
Who follow their Commander
And sing their joyful song:
2. 
And now the foe advancing,
That valiant host assails,
And yet they never falter;
Their courage never fails.
Their Leader calls, âBe faithful!â
They pass the word along;
They see his signal flashing
And shout their joyful song:
3. 
Oh, when the war is ended,
When strife and conflicts cease,
When all are safely gathered
Within the vale of peace,
Before the King eternal,
That vast and mighty throng
Shall praise his name forever,
And this shall be their song:
1. 
The world has need of willing men
Who wear the workerâs seal.
Come, help the good work move along;
Put your shoulder to the wheel.
2. 
The Church has need of helping hands,
And hearts that know and feel.
The work to do is here for you;
Put your shoulder to the wheel.
3. 
Then donât stand idly looking on;
The fight with sin is real.
It will be long but must go on;
Put your shoulder to the wheel.
4. 
Then work and watch and fight and pray
With all your might and zeal.
Push evâry worthy work along;
Put your shoulder to the wheel.
1. 
Like ten thousand legions marching
Moves a mighty band of youth,
Boldly taking to all people
Zionâs glorious song of truth.
2. 
Out of evâry nation surgingâ
Sons of Joseph, Israelâs bandâ
Now they spread salvationâs message
In the tongues of evâry land.
3. 
Far across the mighty waters,
Reaching evâry waiting shore,
Seed of Abraham and Jacob
Like a mighty lion roar.
4. 
Come, ye nations, out of darkness;
âTis the time of Christâs return.
Heed the Restorationâs message;
Let its light within you burn.
1. 
Shall the youth of Zion falter
In defending truth and right?
While the enemy assaileth,
Shall we shrink or shun the fight? No!
2. 
While we know the powârs of darkness
Seek to thwart the work of God,
Shall the children of the promise
Cease to grasp the iron rod? No!
3. 
We will work out our salvation;
We will cleave unto the truth;
We will watch and pray and labor
With the fervent zeal of youth. Yes!
4. 
We will strive to be found worthy
Of the kingdom of our Lord,
With the faithful ones redeemed
Who have loved and kept his word. Yes!
1. 
â Firm as the mountains around us,
Stalwart and brave we stand
On the rock our fathers planted
For us in this goodly landâ
The rock of honor and virtue,
Of faith in the living God.
They raised his banner triumphantâ
Over the desert sod.
2. 
Weâll build on the rock they planted
A palace to the King.
Into its shining corridors
Our songs of praise weâll bring,
For the heritage they left us,
Not of gold or of worldly wealth,
But a blessing everlasting
Of love and joy and health.
1. 
As Zionâs youth in latter days,
We stand with valiant heart,
With promise shining in our eyes,
Resolved to do our part.
Upon a noble past we build;
The future fills our view.
We face the challenge of our day
And pledge we will be true.
2. 
The truths and values we embrace
Are mocked on evâry hand.
Yet as we listen and obey
We know we can withstand
The evils that would weaken us,
The sin that would destroy.
With faith, we hold the iron rod
And find in this our joy.
3. 
Thru test and trial weâll have our fears,
But we will not despair.
Weâre here to serve a righteous cause;
Truth gives us strength to dare.
Weâll love, and learn, and overcome;
Weâll sing a joyful song,
As Zionâs youth in latter days,
Triumphant, pure, and strong.
1. 
Rejoice! A glorious sound is heard
In triumph of the right,
As Zionâs youth, in league with truth,
Go forth in wondrous might.
We raise our voice in loyal shout,
A great exultant cry:
Jehovah reigns! Lord God of Hosts,
All hail thee, King most high.
2. 
And down the ages, on and on,
Increasing evâry hour,
In loyalty and faith we go,
In honor, grace, and powâr.
The Light of Light, Godâs torch of truth,
As beacon points the way
To endless glory, kingdoms great,
In realms of perfect day.
3. 
Arise and sing, ye sons of men;
All praise and honor give.
Arise and sing to his great name,
Who died that we might live.
On Zionâs hill, in strength and might,
Send forth a joyous strain;
In triumph over sin and strife,
With him in glory reign.
1. 
O thou Rock of our salvation,
Jesus, Savior of the world,
In our poor and lowly station
We thy banner have unfurled.
2. 
We a war âgainst sin are waging;
Weâre contending for the right.
Evâry day the battleâs raging;
Help us, Lord, to win the fight.
3. 
Onward, onward, weâll be singing
As weâre marching firm and true,
Each succeeding battle ringing,
Earnest of what we can do.
4. 
When for all that weâve contended,
When the fight of faith weâve won,
When the strife and battleâs ended,
And our labor here is done,
1. 
Hope of Israel, Zionâs army,
Children of the promised day,
See, the Chieftain signals onward,
And the battleâs in array!
2. 
See the foe in countless numbers,
Marshaled in the ranks of sin.
Hope of Israel, on to battle;
Now the victâry we must win!
3. 
Strike for Zion, down with error;
Flash the sword above the foe!
Evâry stroke disarms a foeman;
Evâry step we conqâring go.
4. 
Soon the battle will be over;
Evâry foe of truth be down.
Onward, onward, youth of Zion;
Thy reward the victorâs crown.
1. 
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
Now is the time to show.
We ask it fearlessly:
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
We wage no common war,
Cope with no common foe.
The enemyâs awake;
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
2. 
We serve the living God,
And want his foes to know
That, if but few, weâre great;
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
Weâre going on to win;
No fear must blanch the brow.
The Lord of Hosts is ours;
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
3. 
The stone cut without hands
To fill the earth must grow.
Whoâll help to roll it on?
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
Our ensign to the world
Is floating proudly now.
No coward bears our flag;
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
4. 
The powârs of earth and hell
In rage direct the blow
Thatâs aimed to crush the work;
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
Truth, life, and liberty,
Freedom from death and woe,
Are stakes weâre fighting for;
Whoâs on the Lordâs side? Who?
1. 
Thy servants are prepared
To teach thy word abroad,
To gather in thy sheep
To thee, O Lamb of God.
2. 
Let these, thy servants, speak
With heart and voice of youth,
And fill the worldâs dark lamps
With light, the flame of truth.
3. 
In all of Zionâs stakes
Thy love shall conquer night,
While darkness draws away
From thy revealing light.
1. 
Go, ye messengers of glory;
Run, ye legates of the skies.
Go and tell the pleasing story
That a glorious angel flies,
Great and mighty, Great and mighty,
With a message from the skies.
2. 
Go to evâry tribe and nation;
Visit evâry land and clime.
Sound to all the proclamation;
Tell to all the truth sublime:
That the gospel, That the gospel
Does in ancient glory shine.
3. 
Go, to all the gospel carry;
Let the joyful news abound.
Go till evâry nation hear you,
Jew and Gentile greet the sound.
Let the gospel, Let the gospel
Echo all the earth around.
4. 
Bearing seed of heavânly virtue,
Scatter it oâer all the earth.
Go! Jehovah will support you;
Gather all the sheaves of worth.
Then, with Jesus, Then, with Jesus
Reign in glory on the earth.
1. 
Go forth with faith to tell the world
Of Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Bear witness he is Godâs own Son;
Proclaim his wondrous word.
Go forth with hope and courage strong
To spread the word abroad
That people of all nations
Are children of our God.
2. 
Go forth with love to tell the world
The joy of familiesâ
That we may be with those we love
Thru all eternity.
Go forth to serve and do your best
With no thought of reward;
Then you shall know the boundless joy
Of serving Christ, the Lord.
3. 
Go forth with powâr to tell the world
The gospel is restored,
That all may gain eternal life
Thru Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Go forth to preach his glorious truths
Of peace, of joy, and love,
That all who heed his holy word
May praise the Lord above.
1. 
Hark, all ye nations!Â Hear heavenâs voice
Thru evâry land that all may rejoice!
Angels of glory shout the refrain:
Truth is restored again!
2. 
Searching in darkness, nations have wept;
Watching for dawn, their vigil theyâve kept.
All now rejoice; the long night is oâer.
Truth is on earth once more!
3. 
Chosen by God to serve him below,
To evâry land and people weâll go,
Standing for truth with fervent accord,
Teaching his holy word.
1. 
Arise, O God, and shine
In all thy saving might,
And prosper each design
To spread thy glorious light;
Let healing streams of mercy flow,
That all the earth thy truth may know.
2. 
Bring distant nations near
To sing thy glorious praise;
Let evâry people hear
And learn thy holy ways.
Reign, mighty God, assert thy cause,
And govern by thy righteous laws.
3. 
Put forth thy glorious powâr,
That Gentiles all may see,
And earth present her store
In converts born to thee.
O Lord, our God, thy Church so bless,
And fill the world with righteousness.
4. 
To God, the only wise,
The one immortal King,
Let hallelujahs rise
From evâry living thing;
Let all that breathe, on evâry coast,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
1. 
The time is far spent; there is little remaining
To publish glad tidings by sea and by land.
Then hasten, ye heralds; go forward proclaiming:
Repent, for the kingdom of heavenâs at hand,
Repent, for the kingdom of heavenâs at hand.
2. 
Shrink not from your duty, however unpleasant,
But follow the Savior, your pattern and friend.
Our little afflictions, tho painful at present,
Ere long, with the righteous, in glory will end,
Ere long, with the righteous, in glory will end.
3. 
What, tho, if the favor of Ahman possessing,
This worldâs bitter hate you are called to endure?
The angels are waiting to crown you with blessings!
Go forward, be faithful, the promise is sure.
Go forward, be faithful, the promise is sure.
4. 
Be fixed in your purpose, for Satan will try you;
The weight of your calling he perfectly knows.
Your path may be thorny, but Jesus is nigh you;
His arm is sufficient, tho demons oppose.
His arm is sufficient, tho demons oppose.
1. 
How wondrous and great
Thy works, God of praise!
How just, King of Saints,
And true are thy ways!
Oh, who shall not fear thee
And honor thy name?
Thou only art holy,
Thou only supreme.
2. 
To nations long dark
Thy light shall be shown.
Their worship and vows
Shall come to thy throne.
Thy truth and thy judgments
Shall spread all abroad,
Till earthâs evâry people
Confess thee their God.
1. 
Come, all whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high.
Shall we, to men benighted,
The lamp of life deny?
Salvation! Oh, salvation!
The joyful sound proclaim,
Till earthâs remotest nation
Has learned Messiahâs name.
2. 
From Greenlandâs icy mountains,
From Indiaâs coral strand,
Where Africâs sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand,
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from errorâs chain.
3. 
Go tell, ye winds, his story,
And mighty waters, roll,
Till, like a sea of glory,
It spreads from pole to pole;
Till oâer our ransomed nature
The Lamb, for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator
In bliss returns to reign.
1. 
Jehovah, Lord of heavân and earth,
Thy word of truth proclaim!
Oh, may it spread from pole to pole,
Till all shall know thy name;
Oh, may it spread from pole to pole,
Till all shall know thy name.
2. 
We long to see thy Church increase,
Thine own new kingdom grow,
That all the earth may live in peace,
And heavân be seen below;
That all the earth may live in peace,
And heavân be seen below.
3. 
Roll on thy work in all its powâr!
The distant nations bring!
In thy new kingdom may they stand,
And own thee God and King;
In thy new kingdom may they stand,
And own thee God and King.
4. 
One general chorus then shall rise
From men of evâry tongue,
And songs of joy salute the skies,
By evâry nation sung;
And songs of joy salute the skies,
By evâry nation sung.
1. 
It may not be on the mountain height
Or over the stormy sea,
It may not be at the battleâs front
My Lord will have need of me.
But if, by a still, small voice he calls
To paths that I do not know,
Iâll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine:
Iâll go where you want me to go.
2. 
Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now in the paths of sin
Some wandârer whom I should seek.
O Savior, if thou wilt be my guide,
Tho dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet:
Iâll say what you want me to say.
3. 
Thereâs surely somewhere a lowly place
In earthâs harvest fields so wide
Where I may labor through lifeâs short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So trusting my all to thy tender care,
And knowing thou lovest me,
Iâll do thy will with a heart sincere:
Iâll be what you want me to be.
1. 
Oh, holy words of truth and love
We hear from day to day,
Revealed to Saints from God above,
To guide in heavenâs way.
2. 
Theyâre from Apostles good and true,
Whose names we all revere,
Who daily teach us what to do
In words of love and cheer.
3. 
Theyâre from the prophets God inspires,
In counsels oft withstood,
Reproving all our ill desires,
Commending all thatâs good.
4. 
And from each chosen one that speaks
By aid the Spirit gives,
For every sphere of life it seeks,
For everyone that lives.
5. 
As gems of wisdom, pure and bright,
That glow with lustrous ray,
Weâll seek to gain these words of light,
Their counsels to obey.
1. 
Oh say, what is truth? âTis the fairest gem
That the riches of worlds can produce,
And priceless the value of truth will be when
The proud monarchâs costliest diadem
Is counted but dross and refuse.
2. 
Yes, say, what is truth? âTis the brightest prize
To which mortals or Gods can aspire.
Go search in the depths where it glittering lies,
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies:
âTis an aim for the noblest desire.
3. 
The sceptre may fall from the despotâs grasp
When with winds of stern justice he copes.
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last,
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast
And the wreck of the fell tyrantâs hopes.
4. 
Then say, what is truth? âTis the last and the first,
For the limits of time it steps oâer.
Tho the heavens depart and the earthâs fountains burst,
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,
Eternal, unchanged, evermore.
1. 
Truth reflects upon our senses;
Gospel light reveals to some.
If there still should be offenses,
Woe to them by whom they come!
Judge not, that ye be not judged,
Was the counsel Jesus gave;
Measure given, large or grudged,
Just the same you must receive.
2. 
Jesus said, âBe meek and lowly,â
For âtis high to be a judge;
If I would be pure and holy,
I must love without a grudge.
It requires a constant labor
All his precepts to obey.
If I truly love my neighbor,
I am in the narrow way.
3. 
Once I said unto another,
âIn thine eye there is a mote;
If thou art a friend, a brother,
Hold, and let me pull it out.â
But I could not see it fairly,
For my sight was very dim.
When I came to search more clearly,
In mine eye there was a beam.
4. 
If I love my brother dearer,
And his mote I would erase,
Then the light should shine the clearer,
For the eyeâs a tender place.
Others I have oft reproved
For an object like a mote;
Now I wish this beam removed;
Oh, that tears would wash it out!
5. 
Charity and love are healing;
These will give the clearest sight;
When I saw my brotherâs failing,
I was not exactly right.
Now Iâll take no further trouble;
Jesusâ love is all my theme;
Little motes are but a bubble
When I think upon the beam.
1. 
To Nephi, seer of olden time,
A vision came from God,
Wherein the holy word sublime
Was shown an iron rod.
2. 
While on our journey here below,
Beneath temptationâs powâr,
Through mists of darkness we must go,
In peril evâry hour.
3. 
And when temptationâs powâr is nigh,
Our pathway clouded oâer,
Upon the rod we can rely,
And heavenâs aid implore.
4. 
And, hand oâer hand, the rod along,
Through each succeeding day,
With earnest prayer and hopeful song,
Weâll still pursue our way.
5. 
Afar we see the golden rest
To which the rod will guide,
Where, with the angels bright and blest,
Forever weâll abide.
1. 
A voice hath spoken from the dust,
Its message pure, without alloy,
Of treasured hope and sacred trust:
Oh, âmen are that they might have joy.â
2. 
Should sorrow come, weâll not despair,
For He would not that men should pine.
The grief that comes weâll learn to bear
Until again the sun doth shine.
3. 
Before the Lord, then, humbly go.
His message will our spirits buoy.
On us his blessings heâll bestow,
For âmen are that they might have joy.â
1. 
When the rosy light of morning
Softly beams above the hill,
And the birds, sweet heavânly songsters,
Evâry dell with music fill,
Fresh from slumber we awaken;
Sunshine chases clouds away.
Nature breathes her sweetest fragrance
On the holy Sabbath day.
2. 
For a good and glorious purpose
Thus we meet each Sabbath day,
Each one striving for salvation
Thru the Lordâs appointed way.
Earnest toil will be rewarded;
Zealous hearts need not repine.
God will not withhold his blessings
From the eager, seeking mind.
3. 
Let us then press boldly onward,
Prove ourselves as soldiers true.
He will lead us; he will guide us.
Come, thereâs work for all to do,
Never tiring, never doubting,
Boldly struggling to the end.
In the world, tho foes assail us,
God will surely be our friend.
1. 
As I search the holy scriptures,
Loving Father of mankind,
May my heart be blessed with wisdom,
And may knowledge fill my mind.
2. 
As I search the holy scriptures,
Touch my spirit, Lord, I pray.
May lifeâs mystâries be unfolded
As I study day by day.
3. 
As I search the holy scriptures,
May thy mercy be revealed.
Soothe my troubled heart and spirit;
May my unseen wounds be healed.
4. 
As I search the holy scriptures,
Help me ponder and obey.
In thy word is life eternal;
May thy light show me the way.
1. 
Thanks for the Sabbath School. Hail to the day
When evil and error are fleeing away.
Thanks for our teachers who labor with care
That we in the light of the gospel may share.
2. 
Now in the morning of life let us try
Each virtue to cherish, all vice to decry;
Strive with the noble in deeds that exalt,
And battle with energy each childish fault.
3. 
May we endeavor through lifeâs devious way
To watch and be earnest, true wisdom display;
Try to oâercome each temptation and snare,
Thereby full salvation eternally share.
1. 
We love to hear thy holy word
Proclaimed in latter days.
It lifts our hearts; our souls are stirred
To glorify thy ways.
2. 
We love to read thy holy word
With quiet thought and prayer.
Thy Spiritâs whispârings we have heard;
We feel thy constant care.
3. 
We love to share thy holy word;
Thy gospel we proclaim.
We humbly bear our witness, Lord,
Of thy redeeming name.
4. 
We thank thee for thy holy word;
With joy we sing thy praise.
Oh, help us, Lord, to learn thy word
And live it all our days.
1. 
Welcome, welcome, Sabbath morning;
Now we rest from evâry care.
Welcome, welcome is thy dawning,
Holy Sabbath, day of prayer.
Loving teachers kindly greet us
As we meet in Sunday School,
Where they labor hard to teach us
By the Saviorâs golden rule.
2. 
Hark! the Sabbath bells are ringing;
Hear the echoes all around.
List! the merry children singing!
What a pleasing, joyful sound!
Evâry tender note entreats us,
Bids us come, nor longer stay.
On our way the music greets us;
Hasten, hasten, come away.
3. 
Here we bow in meek devotion;
Here we sing Godâs holy praise.
Here our hearts, with fond emotion,
Seek to learn his holy ways.
From the books of revelation
We are taught while yet in youth.
Words of heavânly inspiration
Guide us in the path of truth.
4. 
Here we meet with friends and neighbors;
Parents too are in the throng.
We are earnest in our labors.
To Godâs kingdom we belong.
Trials make our faith grow stronger;
Truth is nobler than a crown.
We will brave the tempest longer
Tho the world upon us frown.
1. 
Help me teach with inspiration;
Grant this blessing, Lord, I pray.
Help me lift a soulâs ambition
To a higher, nobler way.
2. 
Help me reach a friend in darkness;
Help me guide him thru the night.
Help me show thy path to glory
By the Spiritâs holy light.
3. 
Fill my mind with understanding;
Tune my voice to echo thine.
Touch my hand with gentle friendship;
Warm my heart with love divine.
4. 
Help me find thy lambs who wander;
Help me bring them to thy keep.
Teach me, Lord, to be a shepherd;
Father, help me feed thy sheep.
1. 
We meet again in Sabbath School
On this the Lordâs own day,
Where joyful gladness is the rule,
And love doth bear its sway;
Where all may join in songs of praise
To him who reigns above,
And thankful hearts and voices raise
For his redeeming love.
2. 
We meet again, yes, gladly meet,
To learn the will of God,
For wisdom seeking, that our feet
May walk the narrow road.
O Father, let thy Spirit dwell
In evâry willing heart,
That we may love and serve thee well
And neâer from thee depart.
3. 
Oh, happy day on which we meet
With friends and teachers dear,
And in this ever sweet retreat
Their blessed teachings hear;
With precious truths our minds are stored,
The gospel plan made plain.
Each Sabbath day, with one accord,
Oh, let us meet again.
1. 
The glorious gospel light has shone
In this the latter day
With such intelligence that none
From truth need turn away.
The precious things which had been sealed
And from the world kept hid,
The Lord has to his Saints revealed
As anciently he did.
2. 
And thru the priesthood now restored
Again prepared the way
Thru which the dead may hear his word
And all his laws obey.
As Christ to spirits went to preach
Who were to prison led,
So many Saints have gone to teach
The gospel to the dead.
3. 
And we for them can be baptized,
Yes, for our friends most dear,
That they can with the just be raised
When Gabrielâs trump they hear;
That they may come with Christ again
When he to earth descends,
A thousand years with him to reign,
And with their earthly friends.
4. 
Now, O ye Saints, rejoice today
That you can saviors be
Of all your dead who will obey
The gospel and be free.
Then let us rise without restraint
And act for those we love,
For they are giving their consent
And wait for us to move.
1. 
If you could hie to Kolob
In the twinkling of an eye,
And then continue onward
With that same speed to fly,
Do you think that you could ever,
Through all eternity,
Find out the generation
Where Gods began to be?
2. 
Or see the grand beginning,
Where space did not extend?
Or view the last creation,
Where Gods and matter end?
Methinks the Spirit whispers,
âNo man has found âpure space,â
Nor seen the outside curtains,
Where nothing has a place.â
3. 
The works of God continue,
And worlds and lives abound;
Improvement and progression
Have one eternal round.
There is no end to matter;
There is no end to space;
There is no end to spirit;
There is no end to race.
4. 
There is no end to virtue;
There is no end to might;
There is no end to wisdom;
There is no end to light.
There is no end to union;
There is no end to youth;
There is no end to priesthood;
There is no end to truth.
5. 
There is no end to glory;
There is no end to love;
There is no end to being;
There is no death above.
There is no end to glory;
There is no end to love;
There is no end to being;
There is no death above.
1. 
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants his footsteps in the sea
And rides upon the storm.
2. 
Ye fearful Saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy and shall break
In blessings on your head.
3. 
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding evâry hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.
4. 
Blind unbelief is sure to err
And scan his works in vain;
God is his own interpreter,
And he will make it plain.
1. 
Oh, what songs of the heart
We shall sing all the day,
When again we assemble at home,
When we meet neâer to part
With the blest oâer the way,
There no more from our loved ones to roam!
When we meet neâer to part,
Oh, what songs of the heart
We shall sing in our beautiful home.
2. 
Tho our rapture and bliss
Thereâs no song can express,
We will shout, we will sing oâer and oâer,
As we greet with a kiss,
And with joy we caress
All our loved ones that passed on before;
As we greet with a kiss,
In our rapture and bliss,
All our loved ones that passed on before.
3. 
Oh, the visions weâll see
In that home of the blest,
Thereâs no word, thereâs no thought can impart,
But our rapture will be
All the soul can attest,
In the heavenly songs of the heart;
But our rapture will be
In the vision weâll see
Best expressed in the songs of the heart.
4. 
Oh, what songs weâll employ!
Oh, what welcome weâll hear!
While our transports of love are complete,
As the heart swells with joy
In embraces most dear
When our heavenly parents we meet!
As the heart swells with joy,
Oh, what songs weâll employ,
When our heavenly parents we meet!
1. 
Rise, ye Saints, and temples enter;
Seek the path that leads ahead.
Seal in everlasting circles
All our loved ones, quick and dead.
2. 
Learn the plan of exaltation;
With His sacred laws comply.
Live to earn in binding covânant
Blessings of our God most high.
3. 
Elohim, thou great designer,
Wilt thou heavenâs powârs bestow,
As thy faithful sons and daughters
Serve in temples here below.
1. 
How beautiful thy temples, Lord!
Each one a sacred shrine,
Where faithful Saints, with one accord,
Engage in work divine.
How beautiful some aid to give
To dear ones we call dead,
But who indeed as spirits live;
Theyâve only gone ahead.
2. 
How beautiful thy message, Lord,
The gospel, pure and true,
In these our days to earth restored
And taught to men anew.
How beautiful its faith and hope;
All mankind it would save,
Including in its aim and scope
The souls beyond the grave.
3. 
How beautiful thy promise, Lord,
That we may grow in truth,
And live, exalted by thy word,
In endless, glorious youth.
With loved ones sealed in holiness
By sacred temple rites,
Worlds without end we may progress
From heights to greater heights.
1. 
Holy temples on Mount Zion
In a lofty splendor shine,
Avenues to exaltation,
Symbols of a love divine.
And their kindly portals beckon
To serenity and prayer,
Valiant children of the promise,
Pledged to sacred service there.
2. 
Merciful and gracious Father,
Purify our hearts, we pray;
Bless our mission of redemption
In thy hallowed house each day,
Till at length our faithful kindred,
Sealed with us eternally
In celestial bonds of union,
Sing hosannas unto thee.
3. 
Sing aloud, ye heavânly chorus,
Anthems of eternal praise
To the glorious King Immanuel!
Sing with Saints of latter days!
Let the mountains shout for gladness,
And the valleys joyful be,
While the stars acclaim in rapture,
For the prisoners shall go free.
1. 
Rejoice, ye Saints of latter days,
For temples now in many lands,
Where Saints, endowed with powâr from God,
May learn to keep the Lordâs commands,
May learn to keep the Lordâs commands.
2. 
Come, let us go up to his house;
Weâll make our covenants and say:
âAll we are givân we give to thee.
Accept our love; we will obey.
Accept our love; we will obey.â
3. 
O Saints, rejoice! Our kindred dead
May now receive eternally
The fulness of the gospelâs joy.
Arise, ye Saints, and set them free!
Arise, ye Saints, and set them free!
4. 
His earthly kingdom now prepares
To greet his kingdom from above.
Then will the heavens shout for joy,
And Christ descend to reign in love,
And Christ descend to reign in love.
1. 
Turn your hearts; the Lord is coming,
Malachi the prophet said.
Turn your hearts in preparation
To the work of exaltation
For the living and the dead.
2. 
In the latter days Elijah
Will renew the plan sublime.
He will teach you and remind you
Of the promises that bind you
To all men throughout all time.
3. 
Turn your hearts toward your parentsâ
Generations gone before.
May you seek until you find them;
In the temple seal and bind them
To your hearts forevermore.
4. 
Turn in love to all your childrenâ
Generations yet to be.
May your deeds of gospel giving,
Temple service, righteous living,
Bless them all eternally.
1. 
O my Father, thou that dwellest
In the high and glorious place,
When shall I regain thy presence
And again behold thy face?
In thy holy habitation,
Did my spirit once reside?
In my first primeval childhood
Was I nurtured near thy side?
2. 
For a wise and glorious purpose
Thou hast placed me here on earth
And withheld the recollection
Of my former friends and birth;
Yet ofttimes a secret something
Whispered, âYouâre a stranger here,â
And I felt that I had wandered
From a more exalted sphere.
3. 
I had learned to call thee Father,
Thru thy Spirit from on high,
But, until the key of knowledge
Was restored, I knew not why.
In the heavâns are parents single?
No, the thought makes reason stare!
Truth is reason; truth eternal
Tells me Iâve a mother there.
4. 
When I leave this frail existence,
When I lay this mortal by,
Father, Mother, may I meet you
In your royal courts on high?
Then, at length, when Iâve completed
All you sent me forth to do,
With your mutual approbation
Let me come and dwell with you.
1. 
Each life that touches ours for good
Reflects thine own great mercy, Lord;
Thou sendest blessings from above
Thru words and deeds of those who love.
2. 
What greater gift dost thou bestow,
What greater goodness can we know
Than Christlike friends, whose gentle ways
Strengthen our faith, enrich our days.
3. 
When such a friend from us departs,
We hold forever in our hearts
A sweet and hallowed memory,
Bringing us nearer, Lord, to thee.
4. 
For worthy friends whose lives proclaim
Devotion to the Saviorâs name,
Who bless our days with peace and love,
We praise thy goodness, Lord, above.
1. 
There is beauty all around
When thereâs love at home;
There is joy in evâry sound
When thereâs love at home.
Peace and plenty here abide,
Smiling sweet on evâry side.
Time doth softly, sweetly glide
When thereâs love at home.
Love at home, love at home;
Time doth softly, sweetly glide
When thereâs love at home.
2. 
In the cottage there is joy
When thereâs love at home;
Hate and envy neâer annoy
When thereâs love at home.
Roses bloom beneath our feet;
All the earthâs a garden sweet,
Making life a bliss complete
When thereâs love at home.
Love at home, love at home;
Making life a bliss complete
When thereâs love at home.
3. 
Kindly heaven smiles above
When thereâs love at home;
All the world is filled with love
When thereâs love at home.
Sweeter sings the brooklet by;
Brighter beams the azure sky.
Oh, thereâs One who smiles on high
When thereâs love at home.
Love at home, love at home;
Oh, thereâs One who smiles on high
When thereâs love at home.
1. 
O love that glorifies the Son,
O love that says, âThy will be done!â
Pure love whose spirit makes us oneâ
Come, fill my soul today;
Come, fill my soul today.
2. 
O love that binds our family,
O love that brings my heart to thee,
Pure love that lasts eternallyâ
Come, fill my soul today;
Come, fill my soul today.
3. 
O love that overcomes defeat,
O love that turns the bitter sweet,
Pure love that makes our lives completeâ
Come, fill my soul today;
Come, fill my soul today.
4. 
O Lord, give me the will to mend;
O Lord, change me from foe to friend;
Dear Lord, sustain me to the endâ
Come, fill my soul today;
Come, fill my soul today.
1. 
Our Father, by whose name all fatherhood is known,
Who dost in love proclaim each family thine own,
Bless thou all parents, guarding well,
With constant love as sentinel,
The homes in which thy people dwell.
2. 
As thou thy Child didst fill with wisdom, love, and might,
To know and do thy will and teach thy ways aright,
Our children bless, in evâry place,
That they may all behold thy face,
And, knowing thee, may grow in grace.
3. 
May thy strong Spirit bind our hearts in unity,
And help us each to find the love from self set free.
In all our hearts such love increase,
That evâry home, by this release,
May be the dwelling place of peace.
1. 
From homes of Saints glad songs arise,
For there the Lord is King.
There faith is learned and prayers ascend,
The Spiritâs peace to bring.
For homes where scriptures old are loved,
And living prophets, too,
All thanks we give; the Father praise
For guidance sure and true.
2. 
Godâs truths protect the hearth from wrong
When errorâs ways allure,
Lift minds from self to nobleness,
Keep thought and action pure.
Then sing, O Saints, in hymns of praise;
Sing thanks to God on high,
Whose counsels kept in homes on earth
Bring heavenâs glory nigh.
1. 
Home can be a heavân on earth
When we are filled with love,
Bringing happiness and joy,
Rich blessings from aboveâ
Warmth and kindness, charity,
Safety and securityâ
Making home a part of heaven,
Where we want to be.
2. 
Drawing famâly near each week,
Weâll keep love burning bright.
Serving Him with cheerful hearts,
Weâll grow in truth and light.
Parents teach and lead the way,
Children honor and obey,
Reaching for our home in heaven,
Where we want to stay.
3. 
Praying daily in our home,
Weâll feel His love divine;
Searching scriptures faithfully,
Weâll nourish heart and mind.
Singing hymns of thanks, weâll say,
âFather, help us find the way
Leading to our home in heaven,
Where we long to stay.â
1. 
I have a famâly here on earth.
They are so good to me.
I want to share my life with them through all eternity.
2. 
While I am in my early years,
Iâll prepare most carefully,
So I can marry in Godâs temple for eternity.
1. 
I am a child of God,
And he has sent me here,
Has given me an earthly home
With parents kind and dear.
2. 
I am a child of God,
And so my needs are great;
Help me to understand his words
Before it grows too late.
3. 
I am a child of God.
Rich blessings are in store;
If I but learn to do his will
Iâll live with him once more.
1. 
I know my Father lives and loves me too.
The Spirit whispers this to me and tells me it is true,
And tells me it is true.
2. 
He sent me here to earth, by faith to live his plan.
The Spirit whispers this to me and tells me that I can,
And tells me that I can.
Keep the commandments; keep the commandments!
In this there is safety; in this there is peace.
He will send blessings; He will send blessings.
Words of a prophet: Keep the commandments.
In this there is safety and peace.
1. 
Teach me to walk in the light of his love;
Teach me to pray to my Father above;
Teach me to know of the things that are right;
Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.
2. 
Come, little child, and together weâll learn
Of his commandments, that we may return
Home to his presence, to live in his sightâ
Always, always to walk in the light.
3. 
Father in Heaven, we thank thee this day
For loving guidance to show us the way.
Grateful, we praise thee with songs of delight!
Gladly, gladly weâll walk in the light.
1. 
The light of God rests on the face
Of brook and flowâr and tree
And kindles in our happy hearts
The hope of things to be.
2. 
The light of faith abides within
The heart of evâry child;
Like buds that wait for blossoming,
It grows with radiance mild.
3. 
Today thine unseen purposes
By faithâs rare light we feel.
Dear Father, make us pure in heart;
To us thy will reveal.
1. 
As I watch the rising sun
When the day has just begun,
I am thinking of the love
That comes daily from above.
2. 
Father, turn thine ear to me;
Let me offer thanks to thee
For thy wise and tender care
Of thy children evârywhere.
1. 
In our lovely Deseret,
Where the Saints of God have met,
Thereâs a multitude of children all around.
They are generous and brave;
They have precious souls to save;
They must listen and obey the gospelâs sound.
2. 
That the children may live long
And be beautiful and strong,
Tea and coffee and tobacco they despise,
Drink no liquor, and they eat
But a very little meat;
They are seeking to be great and good and wise.
3. 
They should be instructed young
How to watch and guard the tongue,
And their tempers train and evil passions bind;
They should always be polite,
And treat evârybody right,
And in evâry place be affable and kind.
4. 
They must not forget to pray,
Night and morning evâry day,
For the Lord to keep them safe from evâry ill,
And assist them to do right,
That with all their mind and might
They may love him and may learn to do his will.
As I have loved you,
Love one another.
This new commandment:
Love one another.
By this shall men know
Ye are my disciples,
If ye have love
One to another.
1. 
As sisters in Zion, weâll all work together;
The blessings of God on our labors weâll seek.
Weâll build up his kingdom with earnest endeavor;
Weâll comfort the weary and strengthen the weak.
2. 
The errand of angels is given to women;
And this is a gift that, as sisters, we claim:
To do whatsoever is gentle and human,
To cheer and to bless in humanityâs name.
3. 
How vast is our purpose, how broad is our mission,
If we but fulfill it in spirit and deed.
Oh, naught but the Spiritâs divinest tuition
Can give us the wisdom to truly succeed.
1. 
A key was turned in latter days,
A blessing to restoreâ
A gift of charity and peaceâ
To earth forevermore.
Our Father, we would turn our hearts
To those who seek thy face,
Give hope and comfort to the poor
In memâry of thy grace.
2. 
A hand of mercy weâll extend;
Thy Son has shown the way.
And light and knowledge will attend
Our service in his name.
O sisters, let us join our hands;
Weâll humbly seek his face,
Assure our hearts before our Lord
By deeds of love and praise.
1. 
We meet again as sisters
On this the Sabbath day
To worship God together,
To testify and pray.
Now may the Holy Spirit,
Descending like a dove,
Enlarge our minds with knowledge
And fill our hearts with love.
2. 
We meet to plan our service
To neighbors now in need.
May charity and kindness
Inspire our evâry deed.
And as we use our talents
For good and noble ends,
May God be our companion
And angels be our friends.
3. 
We meet to sing together
The praises of our Lord,
To seek our exaltation
According to his word.
To evâry gospel blessing
The Lord has turned the key,
That we, with heavânly parents,
May sing eternally.
1. 
We ever pray for thee, our prophet dear,
That God will give to thee comfort and cheer;
As the advancing years furrow thy brow,
Still may the light within shine bright as now,
Still may the light within shine bright as now.
2. 
We ever pray for thee with all our hearts,
That strength be given thee to do thy part,
To guide and counsel us from day to day,
To shed a holy light around our way,
To shed a holy light around our way.
3. 
We ever pray for thee with fervent love;
And as the childrenâs prayer is heard above,
Thou shalt be ever blest, and God will give
All that is meet and best while thou shalt live,
All that is meet and best while thou shalt live.
1. 
Earth, with her ten thousand flowârs,
Air, with all its beams and showârs,
Heavenâs infinite expanse,
Seaâs resplendent countenanceâ
All around and all above
Bear this record: God is love.
2. 
Sounds among the vales and hills,
In the woods and by the rills,
Of the breeze and of the bird,
By the gentle murmur stirredâ
Sacred songs, beneath, above,
Have one chorus: God is love.
3. 
All the hopes that sweetly start
From the fountain of the heart,
All the bliss that ever comes
To our earthly human homes,
All the voices from above
Sweetly whisper: God is love.
1. 
How gentle Godâs commands!
How kind his precepts are!
Come, cast your burdens on the Lord
And trust his constant care.
2. 
Beneath his watchful eye,
His Saints securely dwell;
That hand which bears all nature up
Shall guard his children well.
3. 
Why should this anxious load
Press down your weary mind?
Haste to your Heavânly Fatherâs throne
And sweet refreshment find.
4. 
His goodness stands approved,
Unchanged from day to day;
Iâll drop my burden at his feet
And bear a song away.
1. 
Jesus, the very thought of thee
With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far thy face to see
And in thy presence rest.
2. 
Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memâry find
A sweeter sound than thy blest name,
O Savior of mankind!
3. 
O hope of evâry contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who fall, how kind thou art!
How good to those who seek!
4. 
Jesus, our only joy be thou,
As thou our prize wilt be;
Jesus, be thou our glory now,
And thru eternity.
1. 
The Lord is my Shepherd; no want shall I know.
I feed in green pastures; safe-folded I rest.
He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,
Restores me when wandâring, redeems when oppressed,
Restores me when wandâring, redeems when oppressed.
2. 
Thru the valley and shadow of death though I stray,
Since thou art my Guardian, no evil I fear.
Thy rod shall defend me, thy staff be my stay.
No harm can befall with my Comforter near.
No harm can befall with my Comforter near.
3. 
In the midst of affliction my table is spread.
With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth oâer.
With perfume and oil thou anointest my head.
Oh, what shall I ask of thy providence more?
Oh, what shall I ask of thy providence more?
1. 
Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
To praise thy name, give thanks and sing,
To show thy love by morning light,
And talk of all thy truths at night.
2. 
Sweet is the day of sacred rest.
No mortal care shall seize my breast.
Oh, may my heart in tune be found,
Like Davidâs harp of solemn sound!
3. 
My heart shall triumph in my Lord
And bless his works and bless his word.
Thy works of grace, how bright they shine!
How deep thy counsels, how divine!
4. 
But, oh, what triumph shall I raise
To thy dear name through endless days,
When in the realms of joy I see
Thy face in full felicity!
5. 
Sin, my worst enemy before,
Shall vex my eyes and ears no more.
My inward foes shall all be slain,
Nor Satan break my peace again.
6. 
Then shall I see and hear and know
All I desired and wished below,
And every powâr find sweet employ
In that eternal world of joy.
1. 
There is beauty all around
When thereâs love at home;
There is joy in evâry sound
When thereâs love at home.
Peace and plenty here abide,
Smiling sweet on evâry side.
Time doth softly, sweetly glide
When thereâs love at home.
Love at home, love at home;
Time doth softly, sweetly glide
When thereâs love at home.
2. 
In the cottage there is joy
When thereâs love at home;
Hate and envy neâer annoy
When thereâs love at home.
Roses bloom beneath our feet;
All the earthâs a garden sweet,
Making life a bliss complete
When thereâs love at home.
Love at home, love at home;
Making life a bliss complete
When thereâs love at home.
3. 
Kindly heaven smiles above
When thereâs love at home;
All the world is filled with love
When thereâs love at home.
Sweeter sings the brooklet by;
Brighter beams the azure sky.
Oh, thereâs One who smiles on high
When thereâs love at home.
Love at home, love at home;
Oh, thereâs One who smiles on high
When thereâs love at home.
1. 
Ye elders of Israel, come join now with me
And seek out the righteous, whereâer they may beâ
In desert, on mountain, on land, or on seaâ
And bring them to Zion, the pure and the free.
2. 
The harvest is great, and the labârers are few;
But if weâre united, we all things can do.
Weâll gather the wheat from the midst of the tares
And bring them from bondage, from sorrows and snares.
3. 
Weâll go to the poor, like our Captain of old,
And visit the weary, the hungry, and cold;
Weâll cheer up their hearts with the news that he bore
And point them to Zion and life evermore.
1. 
Brethren, powâr by earthly standards
Comes by rank or wealth or sword;
But the powâr above all others
Is the priesthood of our Lord.
2. 
It is ours, the total armorâ
Priesthood held by Christ, our Lordâ
If, as brethren, we are worthy
Of the Spiritâs whispered word.
3. 
Let us venture forth in freedom
With the priesthood as our guideâ
Deacons, teachers, priests, and elders,
Seeking virtue side by side.
1. 
Ye who are called to labor and minister for God,
Blest with the royal priesthood, appointed by his word
To preach among the nations the news of gospel grace,
And publish on the mountains salvation, truth, and peace:
2. 
Oh, let not vain ambition nor worldly glory stain
Your minds so pure and holy; acquit yourselves like men.
While lifting up your voices like trumpets long and loud,
Say to the slumbâring nation: âPrepare to meet your God!â
3. 
Then cease from all light speeches, light-mindedness, and pride;
Pray always without ceasing and in the truth abide.
The Comforter will teach you, his richest blessings send.
Your Savior will be with you forever to the end.
4. 
Rich blessings there await you, and God will give you faith.
You shall be crowned with glory and triumph over death,
And soon youâll come to Zion and, bearing each his sheaf,
No more shall taste of sorrow, but glorious crowns receive.
1. 
Come, all ye sons of God who have received the priesthood;
Go spread the gospel wide and gather in his people.
The latter-day work has begun:
To gather scattered Israel in
And bring them back to Zion to praise the Lamb.
2. 
Come, all ye scattered sheep, and listen to your Shepherd,
While you the blessings reap which long have been predicted.
By prophets long itâs been foretold:
Heâll gather you into his fold
And bring you home to Zion to praise the Lamb.
3. 
Repent and be baptized, and have your sins remitted,
And get the Spiritâs zeal; oh, then youâll be united.
Go cast upon him all your care;
He will regard your humble prayer
And bring you home to Zion to praise the Lamb.
4. 
And when your grief is oâer and ended your affliction,
Your spirits then will soar to await the Resurrection;
And then his presence youâll enjoy,
In heavânly bliss your time employ,
A thousand years in Zion to praise the Lamb.
Rise up, O men of God!
Have done with lesser things.
Give heart and soul and mind and strength
To serve the King of Kings.
Rise up, O men of God,
In one united throng.
Bring in the day of brotherhood
And end the night of wrong.
Rise up, O men of God!
Tread where his feet have trod.
As brothers of the Son of Man,
Rise up, O men of God!
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
1. 
Rise up, O men of God!
Have done with lesser things.
Give heart and soul and mind and strength
To serve the King of Kings.
2. 
Rise up, O men of God,
In one united throng.
Bring in the day of brotherhood
And end the night of wrong.
3. 
Rise up, O men of God!
Tread where his feet have trod.
As brothers of the Son of Man,
Rise up, O men of God!
1. 
See the mighty priesthood gathered;
Firm in serried ranks they standâ
Son and father jointly serving,
Gathered in from evâry land.
Proud their voices blend together,
Raising hymns to Fatherâs praise,
Sending forth the gospel message
As restored in latter days.
2. 
As to Seth his father, Adam,
Powârful precepts did impart,
Humbly each receives the message
Spoken from a prophetâs heart.
Line on line, truth is revealed,
Till all darkness flees away
In the face of perfect knowledge,
Where celestial laws hold sway.
3. 
Come, ye sons, and walk uprightly,
As your noble fathers trodâ
Bearers of the Saviorâs priesthood,
Holding firm the iron rodâ
Till Satanâs powârs are vanquished,
Bound in chains he conquered lies,
And our glorious hallelujahs
Loudly sound across the skies,
And our glorious hallelujahs
Loudly sound, loudly sound across the skies.
1. 
Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;
But with joy wend your way.
Though hard to you this journey may appear,
Grace shall be as your day.
âTis better far for us to strive
Our useless cares from us to drive;
Do this, and joy your hearts will swellâ
All is well! All is well!
2. 
Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard?
âTis not so; all is right.
Why should we think to earn a great reward
If we now shun the fight?
Gird up your loins; fresh courage take.
Our God will never us forsake;
And soon weâll have this tale to tellâ
All is well! All is well!
3. 
Weâll find the place which God for us prepared,
Far away in the West,
Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid;
There the Saints will be blessed.
Weâll make the air with music ring,
Shout praises to our God and King;
Above the rest these words weâll tellâ
All is well! All is well!
4. 
And should we die before our journeyâs through,
Happy day! All is well!
We then are free from toil and sorrow, too;
With the just we shall dwell!
But if our lives are spared again
To see the Saints their rest obtain,
Oh, how weâll make this chorus swellâ
All is well! All is well!
1. 
Go, ye messengers of heaven,
Chosen by divine command;
Go and publish free salvation
To a dark, benighted land.
2. 
Go to island, vale, and mountain;
There fulfill the great command;
Gather out the sons of Jacob
To possess the promised land.
3. 
When your thousands all are gathered,
And their prayers for you ascend,
And the Lord has crowned with blessings
All the labors of your hand,
4. 
Then the song of joy and transport
Will from evâry land resound;
Then the nations long in darkness
By the Savior will be crowned.
1. 
An angel from on high
The long, long silence broke;
Descending from the sky,
These gracious words he spoke:
Lo! in Cumorahâs lonely hill
A sacred record lies concealed.
Lo! in Cumorahâs lonely hill
A sacred record lies concealed.
2. 
Sealed by Moroniâs hand,
It has for ages lain
To wait the Lordâs command,
From dust to speak again.
It shall again to light come forth
To usher in Christâs reign on earth.
It shall again to light come forth
To usher in Christâs reign on earth.
3. 
It speaks of Josephâs seed
And makes the remnant known
Of nations long since dead,
Who once had dwelt alone.
The fulness of the gospel, too,
Its pages will reveal to view.
The fulness of the gospel, too,
Its pages will reveal to view.
4. 
The time is now fulfilled,
The long-expected day;
Let earth obedience yield
And darkness flee away.
Remove the seals; be wide unfurled
Its light and glory to the world.
Remove the seals; be wide unfurled
Its light and glory to the world.
5. 
Lo! Israel filled with joy
Shall now be gathered home,
Their wealth and means employ
To build Jerusalem,
While Zion shall arise and shine
And fill the earth with truth divine.
While Zion shall arise and shine
And fill the earth with truth divine.
1. 
Thy servants are prepared
To teach thy word abroad,
To gather in thy sheep
To thee, O Lamb of God.
2. 
Let these, thy servants, speak
With heart and voice of youth,
And fill the worldâs dark lamps
With light, the flame of truth.
3. 
In all of Zionâs stakes
Thy love shall conquer night,
While darkness draws away
From thy revealing light.
1. 
See, the mighty angel flying;
See, he speeds his way to earth
To proclaim the blessed gospel
And restore the ancient faith,
And restore, and restore the ancient faith.
2. 
Hear, O men, the proclamation;
Cease from vanity and strife.
Hasten to receive the gospel
And obey the words of life,
And obey, and obey the words of life.
3. 
Soon the earth will hear the warning;
Then the judgments will descend!
Oh, before the days of sorrow,
Make the Lord of Hosts your friend!
Make the Lord, make the Lord of Hosts your friend!
4. 
Then when dangers are around you
And the wicked are distressed,
You, with all the Saints of Zion,
Shall enjoy eternal rest,
Shall enjoy, shall enjoy eternal rest.
1. 
Oh say, what is truth? âTis the fairest gem
That the riches of worlds can produce,
And priceless the value of truth will be when
The proud monarchâs costliest diadem
Is counted but dross and refuse.
2. 
Yes, say, what is truth? âTis the brightest prize
To which mortals or Gods can aspire.
Go search in the depths where it glittering lies,
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies:
âTis an aim for the noblest desire.
3. 
The sceptre may fall from the despotâs grasp
When with winds of stern justice he copes.
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last,
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast
And the wreck of the fell tyrantâs hopes.
4. 
Then say, what is truth? âTis the last and the first,
For the limits of time it steps oâer.
Tho the heavens depart and the earthâs fountains burst,
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,
Eternal, unchanged, evermore.
1. 
Come, O thou King of Kings!
Weâve waited long for thee,
With healing in thy wings,
To set thy people free.
Come, thou desire of nations, come;
Let Israel now be gathered home.
2. 
Come, make an end to sin,
And cleanse the earth by fire,
And righteousness bring in,
That Saints may tune the lyre
With songs of joy, a happier strain,
To welcome in thy peaceful reign.
3. 
Hosannas now shall sound
From all the ransomed throng,
And glory echo round
A new triumphal song;
The wide expanse of heaven fill
With anthems sweet from Zionâs hill.
4. 
Hail! Prince of life and peace!
Thrice welcome to thy throne!
While all the chosen race
Their Lord and Savior own,
The heathen nations bow the knee,
And evâry tongue sounds praise to thee.
1. 
High on the mountain top
A banner is unfurled.
Ye nations, now look up;
It waves to all the world.
In Deseretâs sweet, peaceful land,
On Zionâs mount behold it stand!
2. 
For God remembers still
His promise made of old
That he on Zionâs hill
Truthâs standard would unfold!
Her light should there attract the gaze
Of all the world in latter days.
3. 
His house shall there be reared,
His glory to display,
And people shall be heard
In distant lands to say:
Weâll now go up and serve the Lord,
Obey his truth and learn his word.
4. 
For there we shall be taught
The law that will go forth,
With truth and wisdom fraught,
To govern all the earth.
Forever there his ways weâll tread,
And save ourselves with all our dead.
1. 
I need thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord.
No tender voice like thine
Can peace afford.
2. 
I need thee every hour;
Stay thou nearby.
Temptations lose their powâr
When thou art nigh.
3. 
I need thee every hour,
In joy or pain.
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.
4. 
I need thee every hour,
Most holy One.
Oh, make me thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son!
1. 
Brightly beams our Fatherâs mercy
From his lighthouse evermore,
But to us he gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.
2. 
Dark the night of sin has settled;
Loud the angry billows roar.
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.
3. 
Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
Some poor sailor, tempest-tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost.
1. 
School thy feelings, O my brother;
Train thy warm, impulsive soul.
Do not its emotions smother,
But let wisdomâs voice control.
School thy feelings; there is power
In the cool, collected mind.
Passion shatters reasonâs tower,
Makes the clearest vision blind.
2. 
School thy feelings; condemnation
Never pass on friend or foe,
Though the tide of accusation
Like a flood of truth may flow.
Hear defense before deciding,
And a ray of light may gleam,
Showing thee what filth is hiding
Underneath the shallow stream.
3. 
Should afflictionâs acrid vial
Burst oâer thy unsheltered head,
School thy feelings to the trial;
Half its bitterness hath fled.
Art thou falsely, basely, slandered?
Does the world begin to frown?
Gauge thy wrath by wisdomâs standard;
Keep thy rising anger down.
4. 
Rest thyself on this assurance:
Timeâs a friend to innocence,
And the patient, calm endurance
Wins respect and aids defense.
Noblest minds have finest feelings;
Quivâring strings a breath can move;
And the gospelâs sweet revealings
Tune them with the key of love.
5. 
Hearts so sensitively molded
Strongly fortified should be,
Trained to firmness and enfolded
In a calm tranquility.
Wound not willfully another;
Conquer haste with reasonâs might;
School thy feelings, sister, brother;
Train them in the path of right.
1. 
O home belovâd, whereâer I wander,
On foreign land or distant sea,
As time rolls by, my heart grows fonder
And yearns more lovingly for thee!
Tho fair be natureâs scenes around me,
And friends are ever kind and true,
Tho joyous mirth and song surround me,
My heart, my soul still yearn for you.
2. 
The flowârs around me may be fairer
Than those that bloom upon thy hills;
The streams, great, mighty treasure bearers,
More noted may be than thy rills.
No world renown my humble village
Like these great towns may proudly claim;
Yet my fond heart doth thrill with rapture
Wheneâer I hear thy humble name.
3. 
Ye valleys fair and snowcapped mountains,
Ye peaceful hamlets âmid the trees,
Ye murmâring streams and crystal fountains,
Kissed by the cool, soft, balmy breeze,
Words cannot tell how well I love thee
Nor speak my longing when I roam.
My heart alone can cry to heaven,
âGod bless my own dear mountain home.â
1. 
Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.
2. 
Oh, beautiful for pilgrim feet,
Whose stern, impassioned stress
A thoroughfare of freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God mend thine evâry flaw,
Confirm thy soul in self-control,
Thy liberty in law.
3. 
Oh, beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife,
Who more than self their country loved,
And mercy more than life!
America! America!
May God thy gold refine,
Till all success be nobleness,
And evâry gain divine.
4. 
Oh, beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam,
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.
1. 
My country, âtis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I sing;
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the pilgrimsâ pride,
From evâry mountainside
Let freedom ring!
2. 
My native country, thee,
Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love;
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills.
My heart with rapture thrills
Like that above.
3. 
Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedomâs song;
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence break,
The sound prolong.
4. 
Our fathersâ God, to thee,
Author of liberty,
To thee we sing;
Long may our land be bright
With freedomâs holy light.
Protect us by thy might,
Great God, our King!
1. 
Oh say, can you see, by the dawnâs early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilightâs last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,
Oâer the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocketsâ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thru the night that our flag was still there.
Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oâer the land of the free and the home of the brave?
2. 
On the shore, dimly seen thru the mists of the deep,
Where the foeâs haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, oâer the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morningâs first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream;
âTis the star-spangled banner! Oh, long may it wave
Oâer the land of the free and the home of the brave!
3. 
Oh, thus be it ever, when free men shall stand
Between their loved homes and the warâs desolation!
Blest with victâry and peace, may the heavân-rescued land
Praise the Powâr that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: âIn God is our trust!â
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
Oâer the land of the free and the home of the brave!
1. 
God save our gracious king!
Long live our noble king!
God save the king!
Send him victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us;
God save the king!
2. 
Thy choicest gifts in store
On him be pleased to pour;
Long may he reign!
May he defend our laws,
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the king!
