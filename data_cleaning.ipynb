heard the Savior say,\\n'\\x80\\x9cGo and prune my vineyard, son!'\\x80\\x9d\\n2. \\nAnd an angel surely then,\\nFor a blessing unto men,\\nBrought the priesthood back again\\nIn its ancient purity.\\nEven Joseph he inspired;\\nYea, his heart he truly fired\\nWith the light that he desired\\nFor the work of righteousness.\\n3. \\nAnd the Book of Mormon true,\\nWith its cov'nant ever

Joseph'\\x80\\x9d again.\\n1. \\nSaints, behold how great Jehovah\\nHath his blessings on you shed.\\nZion ev'rywhere is growing\\nAs the gospel light is spread!\\n2. \\nOut of all past dispensations,\\nGod is bringing into one\\nEv'ry truth by prophets spoken,\\nFor the last days have begun.\\n3. \\nRise and lift up Zion's standard;\\nTell our Father's children now:\\nHeaven's blessed King approaches;\\nAll men must before him bow.\\n1. \\nA poor wayfaring Man of grief\\nHath often crossed me on my way,\\nWho sued so humbly for relief\\nThat I could never answer nay.\\nI had not pow'r to ask his name,\\nWhereto he went, or whence he came;\\nYet there was something in his eye\\nThat won my love; I knew not why.\\n2. \\nOnce, when my scanty meal was spread,\\nHe entered; not a word he spake,\\nJust perishing for want of bread.\\nI gave him all; he blessed it, brake,\\nAnd ate, but gave me part again.\\nMine was an angel's portion then,\\nFor while I fed with eager haste,\\nThe crust was manna to my taste.\\n3. \\nI spied him where a fountain burst\\nClear from the rock; his strength was gone.\\nThe heedless water mocked his thirst;\\nHe heard it, saw it hurrying on.\\nI ran and raised the suff'rer up;\\nThrice from the stream he drained my cup,\\nDipped and returned it running o'er;\\nI drank and never thirsted more.\\n4. \\n'Twas night; the floods were out; it blew\\nA winter hurricane aloof.\\nI heard his voice abroad and flew\\nTo bid him welcome to my roof.\\nI warmed and clothed and cheered my guest\\nAnd laid him on my couch to rest,\\nThen made the earth my bed and seemed\\nIn Eden's garden while I dreamed.\\n5. \\nStript, wounded, beaten nigh to death,\\nI found him by the highway side.\\nI roused his pulse, brought back his breath,\\nRevived his spirit, and supplied\\nWine, oil, refreshment'\\x80\\x94he was healed.\\nI had myself a wound concealed,\\nBut from that hour forgot the smart,\\nAnd peace bound up my broken heart.\\n6. \\nIn pris'n I saw him next, condemned\\nTo meet a traitor's doom at morn.\\nThe tide of lying tongues I stemmed,\\nAnd honored him 'mid shame and scorn.\\nMy friendship's utmost zeal to try,\\nHe asked if I for him would die.\\nThe flesh was weak; my blood ran chill,\\nBut my free spirit cried, '\\x80\\x9cI will!'\\x80\\x9d\\n7. \\nThen in a moment to my view\\nThe stranger started from disguise.\\nThe tokens in his hands I knew;\\nThe Savior stood before mine eyes.\\nHe spake, and my poor name he named,\\n'\\x80\\x9cOf me thou hast not been ashamed.\\nThese deeds shall thy memorial be;\\nFear not, thou didst them unto me.'\\x80\\x9d\\n1. \\nCome, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;\\nBut with joy wend your way.\\nThough hard to you this journey may appear,\\nGrace shall be as your day.\\n'Tis better far for us to strive\\nOur useless cares from us to drive;\\nDo this, and joy your hearts will swell'\\x80\\x94\\nAll is well! All is well!\\n2. \\nWhy should we mourn or think our lot is hard?\\n'Tis not so; all is right.\\nWhy should we think to earn a great reward\\nIf we now shun the fight?\\nGird up your loins; fresh courage take.\\nOur God will never us forsake;\\nAnd soon we'll have this tale to tell'\\x80\\x94\\nAll is well! All is well!\\n3. \\nWe'll find the place which God for us prepared,\\nFar away in the West,\\nWhere none shall come to hurt or make afraid;\\nThere the Saints will be blessed.\\nWe'll make the air with music ring,\\nShout praises to our God and King;\\nAbove the rest these words we'll tell'\\x80\\x94\\nAll is well! All is well!\\n4. \\nAnd should we die before our journey's through,\\nHappy day! All is well!\\nWe then are free from toil and sorrow, too;\\nWith the just we shall dwell!\\nBut if our lives are spared again\\nTo see the Saints their rest obtain,\\nOh, how we'll make this chorus swell'\\x80\\x94\\nAll is well! All is well!\\n1. \\nO God, our help in ages past,\\nOur hope for years to come,\\nOur shelter from the stormy blast,\\nAnd our eternal home.\\n2. \\nWithin the shadow of thy throne,\\nStill may we dwell secure.\\nSufficient is thine arm alone,\\nAnd our defense is sure.\\n3. \\nBefore the hills in order stood,\\nOr earth received her frame,\\nFrom everlasting thou art God,\\nTo endless years the same.\\n4. \\nO God, our help in ages past,\\nOur hope for years to come,\\nBe thou our guide while life shall last\\nAnd our eternal home.\\n1. \\nThe happy day at last has come.\\nThe truth restored is now made known.\\nThe promised angel's come again\\nTo introduce Messiah's reign.\\n2. \\nThe gospel trump again is heard.\\nThe truth from darkness has appeared.\\nThe lands which long benighted lay\\nHave now beheld a glorious day:\\n3. \\nThe day by prophets long foretold,\\nThe day which Abram did behold,\\nThe day that Saints desired so long,\\nWhen God his great work would perform,\\n4. \\nThe day when Saints again shall hear\\nThe voice of Jesus in their ear,\\nAnd angels, who above do reign,\\nCome down to speak again with men.\\n1. \\nOur mountain home so dear,\\nWhere crystal waters clear\\nFlow ever free,\\nFlow ever free,\\nWhile thru the valleys wide\\nThe flow'rs on ev'ry side,\\nBlooming in stately pride,\\nAre fair to see.\\n2. \\nWe'll roam the verdant hills\\nAnd by the sparkling rills\\nPluck the wildflow'rs,\\nPluck the wildflow'rs;\\nThe fragrance on the air,\\nThe landscape bright and fair,\\nAnd sunshine ev'rywhere\\nMake pleasant hours.\\n3. \\nIn sylvan depth and shade,\\nIn forest and in glade,\\nWhere-e'er we pass,\\nWhere-e'er we pass,\\nThe hand of God we see\\nIn leaf and bud and tree,\\nOr bird or humming bee,\\nOr blade of grass.\\n4. \\nThe streamlet, flow'r, and sod\\nBespeak the works of God;\\nAnd all combine,\\nAnd all combine,\\nWith most transporting grace,\\nHis handiwork to trace,\\nThru nature's smiling face,\\nIn art divine.\\n1. \\nO ye mountains high, where the clear blue sky\\nArches over the vales of the free,\\nWhere the pure breezes blow and the clear streamlets flow,\\nHow I've longed to your bosom to flee!\\nO Zion! dear Zion! land of the free,\\nNow my own mountain home, unto thee I have come;\\nAll my fond hopes are centered in thee.\\n2. \\nTho the great and the wise all thy beauties despise,\\nTo the humble and pure thou art dear;\\nTho the haughty may smile and the wicked revile,\\nYet we love thy glad tidings to hear.\\nO Zion! dear Zion! home of the free,\\nTho thou wert forced to fly to thy chambers on high,\\nYet we'll share joy and sorrow with thee.\\n3. \\nIn thy mountain retreat, God will strengthen thy feet;\\nWithout fear of thy foes thou shalt tread;\\nAnd their silver and gold, as the prophets have told,\\nShall be brought to adorn thy fair head.\\nO Zion! dear Zion! home of the free,\\nSoon thy towers shall shine with a splendor divine,\\nAnd eternal thy glory shall be.\\n4. \\nHere our voices we'll raise, and we'll sing to thy praise,\\nSacred home of the prophets of God.\\nThy deliv'rance is nigh; thy oppressors shall die;\\nAnd thy land shall be freedom's abode.\\nO Zion! dear Zion! land of the free,\\nIn thy temples we'll bend; all thy rights we'll defend;\\nAnd our home shall be ever with thee.\\n1. \\nFor the strength of the hills we bless thee,\\nOur God, our fathers' God;\\nThou hast made thy children mighty\\nBy the touch of the mountain sod.\\nThou hast led thy chosen Israel\\nTo freedom's last abode;\\n2. \\nAt the hands of foul oppressors\\nWe've borne and suffered long;\\nThou hast been our help in weakness,\\nAnd thy pow'r hath made us strong.\\nAmid ruthless foes outnumbered\\nIn weariness we trod;\\n3. \\nThou hast led us here in safety\\nWhere the mountain bulwark stands\\nAs the guardian of the loved ones\\nThou hast brought from many lands.\\nFor the rock and for the river,\\nThe valley's fertile sod,\\n4. \\nWe are watchers of a beacon\\nWhose light must never die;\\nWe are guardians of an altar\\n'Midst the silence of the sky.\\nHere the rocks yield founts of courage,\\nStruck forth as by thy rod;\\n1. \\nThey, the builders of the nation,\\nBlazing trails along the way;\\nStepping-stones for generations\\nWere their deeds of ev'ry day.\\nBuilding new and firm foundations,\\nPushing on the wild frontier,\\nForging onward, ever onward,\\nBlessed, honored Pioneer!\\n2. \\nService ever was their watchcry;\\nLove became their guiding star;\\nCourage, their unfailing beacon,\\nRadiating near and far.\\nEv'ry day some burden lifted,\\nEv'ry day some heart to cheer,\\nEv'ry day some hope the brighter,\\nBlessed, honored Pioneer!\\n3. \\nAs an ensign to the nation,\\nThey unfurled the flag of truth,\\nPillar, guide, and inspiration\\nTo the hosts of waiting youth.\\nHonor, praise, and veneration\\nTo the founders we revere!\\nList our song of adoration,\\nBlessed, honored Pioneer!\\n1. \\nThe wintry day, descending to its close,\\nInvites all wearied nature to repose,\\nAnd shades of night are falling dense and fast,\\nLike sable curtains closing o'er the past.\\nPale through the gloom the newly fallen snow\\nWraps in a shroud the silent earth below\\nAs tho 'twere mercy's hand had spread the pall,\\nA symbol of forgiveness unto all.\\n2. \\nI cannot go to rest, but linger still\\nIn meditation at my windowsill,\\nWhile, like the twinkling stars in heaven's dome,\\nCome one by one sweet memories of home.\\nAnd wouldst thou ask me where my fancy roves\\nTo reproduce the happy scenes it loves,\\nWhere hope and memory together dwell\\nAnd paint the pictured beauties that I tell?\\n3. \\nAway beyond the prairies of the West,\\nWhere exiled Saints in solitude were blest,\\nWhere industry the seal of wealth has set\\nAmid the peaceful vales of Deseret,\\nUnheeding still the fiercest blasts that blow,\\nWith tops encrusted by eternal snow,\\nThe tow'ring peaks that shield the tender sod\\nStand, types of freedom reared by nature's God.\\n4. \\nThe wilderness, that naught before would yield,\\nIs now become a fertile, fruitful field.\\nWhere roamed at will the fearless Indian band,\\nThe templed cities of the Saints now stand.\\nAnd sweet religion in its purity\\nInvites all men to its security.\\nThere is my home, the spot I love so well,\\nWhose worth and beauty pen nor tongue can tell.\\n1. \\nCome, all ye Saints of Zion,\\nAnd let us praise the Lord;\\nHis ransomed are returning,\\nAccording to his word.\\nIn sacred song and gladness\\nThey walk the narrow way\\nAnd thank the Lord who brought them\\nTo see the latter day.\\n2. \\nCome, ye dispersed of Judah,\\nJoin in the theme and sing\\nWith harmony unceasing\\nThe praises of our King,\\nWhose arm is now extended,\\nOn which the world may gaze,\\nTo gather up the righteous\\nIn these the latter days.\\n3. \\nRejoice, rejoice, O Israel,\\nAnd let your joys abound!\\nThe voice of God shall reach you\\nWherever you are found\\nAnd call you back from bondage,\\nThat you may sing his praise\\nIn Zion and Jerusalem,\\nIn these the latter days.\\n4. \\nThen gather up for Zion,\\nYe Saints thruout the land,\\nAnd clear the way before you,\\nAs God shall give command.\\nTho wicked men and devils\\nExert their pow'r, 'tis vain,\\nSince He who is eternal\\nHas said you shall obtain.\\n1. \\nO Saints of Zion, hear the voice\\nOf Him from courts on high.\\nPrepare the pathway of the Lord;\\nHis reign on earth is nigh.\\nPrepare the supper of the Lamb;\\nInvite the world to dine.\\nBehold, the mighty Bridegroom comes\\nIn majesty divine.\\n2. \\nEntreat the Lord in humble prayer\\nThat all the sons of men\\nHis righteous kingdom will receive\\nAnd shout the glad '\\x80\\x9camen.'\\x80\\x9d\\nThe sacred keys are now restored;\\nDeclare the gospel plan.\\nMake known the wondrous words of truth\\nRevealed again to man.\\n3. \\nBehold, the glory of the Lord\\nSets Zion's mount aglow,\\nFor Zion is an ensign pure;\\nAll nations to her flow.\\nO Saints of Zion, tread the paths\\nYour faithful fathers trod.\\nLift up your hearts in gratitude\\nAnd serve the living God!\\n1. \\nArise, O glorious Zion,\\nThou joy of latter days,\\nWhom countless Saints rely on\\nTo gain a resting place.\\nArise and shine in splendor\\nAmid the world's deep night,\\nFor God, thy sure defender,\\nIs now thy life and light.\\n2. \\nFrom Zion's favored dwelling\\nThe gospel issues forth,\\nThe covenant revealing\\nTo gather all the earth;\\nAnd Saints, the message bringing\\nTo all the sons of men,\\nWith the redeemed shall, singing,\\nTo Zion come again.\\n3. \\nThru painful tribulation\\nWe walk the narrow road\\nAnd battle with temptation\\nTo gain the blest abode.\\nBut patient, firm endurance,\\nWith glory in our view,\\nThe Spirit's bright assurance\\nWill bring us conq'rors through.\\n4. \\nOh, grant, Eternal Father,\\nThat we may faithful be,\\nWith all the just to gather,\\nAnd thy salvation see!\\nThen, with the hosts of heaven,\\nWe'll sing th'immortal theme:\\nTo him be glory given\\nWhose blood did us redeem.\\n1. \\nLet Zion in her beauty rise;\\nHer light begins to shine.\\nEre long her King will rend the skies,\\nMajestic and divine,\\nThe gospel spreading thru the land,\\nA people to prepare\\nTo meet the Lord and Enoch's band\\nTriumphant in the air.\\n2. \\nYe heralds, sound the golden trump\\nTo earth's remotest bound.\\nGo spread the news from pole to pole\\nIn all the nations round:\\nThat Jesus in the clouds above,\\nWith hosts of angels too,\\nWill soon appear, his Saints to save,\\nHis enemies subdue.\\n3. \\nThat glorious rest will then commence\\nWhich prophets did foretell,\\nWhen Saints will reign with Christ on earth,\\nAnd in his presence dwell\\nA thousand years, oh, glorious day!\\nDear Lord, prepare my heart\\nTo stand with thee on Zion's mount\\nAnd nevermore to part.\\n1. \\nHail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning!\\nJoy to the lands that in darkness have lain!\\nHushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning.\\nZion in triumph begins her glad reign.\\n2. \\nHail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning,\\nLong by the prophets of Israel foretold!\\nHail to the millions from bondage returning!\\nGentiles and Jews the glad vision behold.\\n3. \\nLo! in the desert the flowers are springing;\\nStreams, ever copious, are gliding along.\\nLoud from the mountaintops echoes are ringing;\\nWastes rise in verdure and mingle in song.\\n4. \\nHark! from all lands, from the isles of the ocean,\\nPraise to Jehovah ascending on high.\\nFallen the engines of war and commotion;\\nShouts of salvation are rending the sky.\\n1. \\nZion stands with hill surrounded'\\x80\\x94\\nZion, kept by pow'r divine.\\nAll her foes shall be confounded,\\nThough the world in arms combine.\\nHappy Zion, Happy Zion,\\nWhat a favored lot is thine!\\n2. \\nEv'ry human tie may perish,\\nFriend to friend unfaithful prove,\\nMothers cease their own to cherish,\\nHeav'n and earth at last remove.\\nBut no changes, But no changes\\nCan attend Jehovah's love.\\n3. \\nIn the furnace God may prove thee,\\nThence to bring thee forth more bright,\\nBut can never cease to love thee;\\nThou art precious in his sight.\\nGod is with thee, God is with thee;\\nThou shalt triumph in his might.\\n1. \\nBeautiful Zion, built above;\\nBeautiful city that I love;\\nBeautiful gates of pearly white;\\nBeautiful temple'\\x80\\x94God its light;\\nHe who was slain on Calvary\\nOpens those pearly gates for me.\\n2. \\nBeautiful heav'n, where all is light;\\nBeautiful angels clothed in white;\\nBeautiful strains that never tire;\\nBeautiful harps thru all the choir;\\nThere shall I join the chorus sweet,\\nWorshiping at the Savior's feet.\\n3. \\nBeautiful crowns on ev'ry brow;\\nBeautiful palms the conq'rors show;\\nBeautiful robes the ransomed wear;\\nBeautiful all who enter there;\\nThither I press with eager feet;\\nThere shall my rest be long and sweet.\\n1. \\nLead me into life eternal\\nBy the gospel's holy call.\\nLet thy promise rest upon me;\\nGrant me ready strength for all.\\n2. \\nFather, all my heart I give thee;\\nAll my service shall be thine.\\nGuide me as I search in weakness;\\nLet thy loving light be mine.\\n3. \\nHear me as I pray in meekness;\\nLet my strength be as thy day.\\nGive me faith, the greater knowledge;\\nFather, bless me as I pray.\\n1. \\nGlorious things of thee are spoken,\\nZion, city of our God!\\nHe whose word cannot be broken\\nChose thee for his own abode.\\nOn the Rock of Ages founded,\\nWhat can shake our sure repose?\\nWith salvation's wall surrounded,\\nThou may'st smile on all thy foes.\\n2. \\nSee! the streams of living waters,\\nSpringing from celestial love,\\nWell supply thy sons and daughters\\nAnd all fear of drought remove.\\nRound each habitation hov'ring,\\nSee the cloud and fire appear\\nFor a glory and a cov'ring,\\nShowing that the Lord is near.\\n3. \\nBlest inhabitants of Zion,\\nPurchased by the Savior's blood;\\nJesus, whom their souls rely on,\\nMakes them kings and priests to God.\\nWhile in love his Saints he raises,\\nWith himself to reign as King,\\nAll, as priests, his solemn praises\\nFor thank-off'rings freely bring.\\n1. \\nWe will sing of Zion,\\nKingdom of our God.\\nZion is the pure in heart,\\nThose who seek the Savior's part.\\nZion soon in all the world\\nWill rise to meet her God.\\n2. \\nThru the revelations\\nGiv'n by God to men,\\nHeaven's truth is placed on earth;\\nProphets teach its pow'r and worth.\\nZion readies us to see\\nThe Savior come again.\\n3. \\nWhen the Saints of Zion\\nKeep his law in truth,\\nHate and war and strife will cease;\\nMen will live in love and peace.\\nHeav'nly Zion, come once more\\nAnd cover all the earth.\\n1. \\nGlorious things are sung of Zion,\\nEnoch's city seen of old,\\nWhere the righteous, being perfect,\\nWalked with God in streets of gold.\\nLove and virtue, faith and wisdom,\\nGrace and gifts were all combined.\\nAs himself each loved his neighbor;\\nAll were one in heart and mind.\\n2. \\nThere they shunn'd the pow'r of Satan\\nAnd observed celestial laws;\\nFor in Adam-ondi-Ahman\\nZion rose where Eden was.\\nWhen beyond the pow'r of evil,\\nSo that none could covet wealth,\\nOne continual feast of blessings\\nCrown'd their days with peace and health.\\n3. \\nThen the tow'rs of Zion glittered\\nLike the sun in yonder skies,\\nAnd the wicked stood and trembled,\\nFilled with wonder and surprise.\\nThen their faith and works were perfect;\\nLo, they followed their great Head!\\nSo the city went to heaven,\\nAnd the world said, '\\x80\\x9cZion's fled!'\\x80\\x9d\\n4. \\nWhen the Lord returns with Zion,\\nAnd we hear the watchman cry,\\nThen we'll surely be united,\\nAnd we'll all see eye to eye.\\nThen we'll mingle with the angels,\\nAnd the Lord will bless his own.\\nThen the earth will be as Eden,\\nAnd we'll know as we are known.\\n1. \\nThis earth was once a garden place,\\nWith all her glories common,\\nAnd men did live a holy race,\\nAnd worship Jesus face to face,\\nIn Adam-ondi-Ahman.\\n2. \\nWe read that Enoch walked with God,\\nAbove the pow'r of mammon,\\nWhile Zion spread herself abroad,\\nAnd Saints and angels sang aloud,\\nIn Adam-ondi-Ahman.\\n3. \\nHer land was good and greatly blest,\\nBeyond all Israel's Canaan;\\nHer fame was known from east to west,\\nHer peace was great, and pure the rest\\nOf Adam-ondi-Ahman.\\n4. \\nHosanna to such days to come,\\nThe Savior's second coming,\\nWhen all the earth in glorious bloom\\nAffords the Saints a holy home,\\nLike Adam-ondi-Ahman.\\n1. \\nCome, thou glorious day of promise;\\nCome and spread thy cheerful ray,\\nWhen the scattered sheep of Israel\\nShall no longer go astray,\\nWhen hosannas,\\nWhen hosannas\\nWith united voice they'll cry.\\n2. \\nLord, how long wilt thou be angry?\\nShall thy wrath forever burn?\\nRise, redeem thine ancient people;\\nTheir transgressions from them turn.\\nKing of Israel,\\nKing of Israel,\\nCome and set thy people free.\\n3. \\nOh, that soon thou wouldst to Jacob\\nThy enliv'ning Spirit send!\\nOf their unbelief and misery\\nMake, O Lord, a speedy end.\\nLord, Messiah!\\nLord, Messiah!\\nPrince of Peace o'er Israel reign.\\n1. \\nSons of Michael, he approaches!\\nRise, the ancient father greet.\\nBow, ye thousands, low before him;\\nMinister before his feet.\\nHail the patriarch's glad reign,\\nSpreading over sea and main.\\n2. \\nSons of Michael, 'tis his chariot\\nRolls its burning wheels along!\\nRaise aloft your voices million\\nIn a torrent pow'r of song.\\nHail our head with music soft!\\nRaise sweet melodies aloft!\\n3. \\nMother of our generations,\\nGlorious by great Michael's side,\\nTake thy children's adoration;\\nEndless with thy seed abide.\\nLo! to greet thee now advance\\nThousands in the glorious dance!\\n4. \\nRaise a chorus, sons of Michael,\\nLike old ocean's roaring swell,\\nTill the mighty acclamation\\nThru rebounding space doth tell\\nThat the ancient one doth reign\\nIn his Father's house again!\\n1. \\nThe day dawn is breaking, the world is awaking,\\nThe clouds of night's darkness are fleeing away.\\nThe worldwide commotion, from ocean to ocean,\\nNow heralds the time of the beautiful day.\\n2. \\nIn many a temple the Saints will assemble\\nAnd labor as saviors of dear ones away.\\nThen happy reunion and sweetest communion\\nWe'll have with our friends in the beautiful day.\\n3. \\nStill let us be doing, our lessons reviewing,\\nWhich God has revealed for our walk in his way;\\nAnd then, wondrous story, the Lord in his glory\\nWill come in his pow'r in the beautiful day.\\n4. \\nThen pure and supernal, our friendship eternal,\\nWith Jesus we'll live and his counsels obey\\nUntil ev'ry nation will join in salvation\\nAnd worship the Lord of the beautiful day.\\n1. \\nLet earth's inhabitants rejoice\\nAnd gladly hail the glorious hour;\\nAgain is heard a prophet's voice,\\nAnd all may feel the gospel's pow'r.\\n2. \\nThe blissful time will soon arrive,\\nThe day by holy men foretold,\\nWhen man no more with man will strive,\\nAnd all in each a friend behold.\\n3. \\nOppression will no more be found,\\nNor tyrant hold relentless sway,\\nBut love to God and man abound\\nThruout the long millennial day.\\n1. \\nBehold, the mountain of the Lord\\nIn latter days shall rise\\nOn mountaintops, above the hills,\\nAnd draw the wond'ring eyes.\\nTo this shall joyful nations come;\\nAll tribes and tongues shall flow.\\n'\\x80\\x9cUp to the hill of God,'\\x80\\x9d they'll say,\\n'\\x80\\x9cAnd to his house we'll go.'\\x80\\x9d\\n2. \\nThe rays that shine from Zion's hill\\nShall lighten ev'ry land;\\nThe King who reigns in Salem's tow'r\\nShall all the world command.\\nAmong the nations he shall judge;\\nHis judgments truth shall guide;\\nHis scepter shall protect the just\\nAnd quell the sinner's pride.\\n3. \\nNo strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds\\nDisturb those peaceful years;\\nTo plowshares men shall beat their swords,\\nTo pruning hooks their spears.\\nNo longer host encount'ring host\\nShall crowds of slain deplore;\\nThey'll hang the trumpet in the hall\\nAnd study war no more.\\n4. \\nCome, then, O house of Jacob, come,\\nTo worship at His shrine,\\nAnd, walking in the light of God,\\nWith holy beauties shine.\\nCome, then, O house of Jacob, come,\\nTo worship at His shrine,\\nAnd, walking in the light of God,\\nWith holy beauties shine.\\n1. \\nLo, the mighty God appearing!\\nFrom on high Jehovah speaks!\\nEastern lands the summons hearing,\\nO'er the west his thunder breaks.\\nEarth behold him! Earth behold him!\\nUniversal nature shakes.\\nEarth behold him! Earth behold him!\\nUniversal nature shakes.\\n2. \\nZion, all its light unfolding,\\nGod in glory shall display.\\nLo! he comes! nor silence holding;\\nFire and clouds prepare his way.\\nTempests round him! Tempests round him!\\nHasten on the dreadful day.\\nTempests round him! Tempests round him!\\nHasten on the dreadful day.\\n3. \\nTo the heav'ns his voice ascending,\\nTo the earth beneath he cries.\\nSouls immortal, now descending,\\nLet their sleeping dust arise!\\nRise to judgment! Rise to judgment!\\nLet thy throne adorn the skies.\\nRise to judgment! Rise to judgment!\\nLet thy throne adorn the skies.\\n4. \\nNow the heav'ns on high adore him\\nAnd his righteousness declare.\\nSinners perish from before him,\\nBut his Saints his mercies share.\\nJust his judgments! Just his judgments!\\nGod, himself the judge, is there.\\nJust his judgments! Just his judgments!\\nGod, himself the judge, is there.\\n1. \\nSoftly beams the sacred dawning\\nOf the great millennial morn,\\nAnd to Saints gives welcome warning\\nThat the day is hast'ning on,\\nThat the day is hast'ning on.\\n2. \\nSplendid, rising o'er the mountains,\\nGlowing with celestial cheer,\\nStreaming from eternal fountains,\\nRays of living light appear,\\nRays of living light appear.\\n3. \\nSwiftly flee the clouds of darkness;\\nSpeedily the mists retire;\\nNature's universal blackness\\nIs consumed by heav'nly fire,\\nIs consumed by heav'nly fire.\\n4. \\nYea, the fair sabbatic era,\\nWhen the world will be at rest,\\nRapidly is drawing nearer;\\nThen all Israel will be blest,\\nThen all Israel will be blest.\\n1. \\nWe're not ashamed to own our Lord\\nAnd worship him on earth.\\nWe love to learn his holy word\\nAnd know what souls are worth.\\n2. \\nWhen Jesus comes in burning flame\\nTo recompense the just,\\nThe world will know the only name\\nIn which the Saints can trust.\\n3. \\nWhen he comes down from heav'n to earth\\nWith all his holy band,\\nBefore creation's second birth,\\nWe hope with him to stand.\\n4. \\nHe then will give us a new name,\\nWith robes of righteousness,\\nAnd, in the New Jerusalem,\\nEternal happiness.\\n1. \\nCome, ye children of the Lord,\\nLet us sing with one accord.\\nLet us raise a joyful strain\\nTo our Lord who soon will reign\\nOn this earth when it shall be\\nCleansed from all iniquity,\\nWhen all men from sin will cease,\\nAnd will live in love and peace.\\n2. \\nOh, how joyful it will be\\nWhen our Savior we shall see!\\nWhen in splendor he'll descend,\\nThen all wickedness will end.\\nOh, what songs we then will sing\\nTo our Savior, Lord, and King!\\nOh, what love will then bear sway\\nWhen our fears shall flee away!\\n3. \\nAll arrayed in spotless white,\\nWe will dwell 'mid truth and light.\\nWe will sing the songs of praise;\\nWe will shout in joyous lays.\\nEarth shall then be cleansed from sin.\\nEv'ry living thing therein\\nShall in love and beauty dwell;\\nThen with joy each heart will swell.\\n1. \\nCome, O thou King of Kings!\\nWe've waited long for thee,\\nWith healing in thy wings,\\nTo set thy people free.\\nCome, thou desire of nations, come;\\nLet Israel now be gathered home.\\n2. \\nCome, make an end to sin,\\nAnd cleanse the earth by fire,\\nAnd righteousness bring in,\\nThat Saints may tune the lyre\\nWith songs of joy, a happier strain,\\nTo welcome in thy peaceful reign.\\n3. \\nHosannas now shall sound\\nFrom all the ransomed throng,\\nAnd glory echo round\\nA new triumphal song;\\nThe wide expanse of heaven fill\\nWith anthems sweet from Zion's hill.\\n4. \\nHail! Prince of life and peace!\\nThrice welcome to thy throne!\\nWhile all the chosen race\\nTheir Lord and Savior own,\\nThe heathen nations bow the knee,\\nAnd ev'ry tongue sounds praise to thee.\\n1. \\nMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;\\nHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\\nHe hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible, swift sword;\\nHis truth is marching on.\\n2. \\nHe has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;\\nHe is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat.\\nOh, be swift, my soul, to answer him; be jubilant my feet!\\nOur God is marching on.\\n3. \\nIn the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,\\nWith a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.\\nAs he died to make men holy, let us live to make men free,\\nWhile God is marching on.\\n1. \\nRaise your voices to the Lord,\\nYe who here have heard his word.\\nAs we part, his praise proclaim,\\nShout thanksgiving to his name.\\n2. \\nShout thanksgiving! Let our song\\nStill our joy and praise prolong,\\nUntil here we meet again\\nTo renew the glad refrain.\\n1. \\nAll creatures of our God and King,\\nLift up your voice and with us sing,\\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\\nThou burning sun with golden beam,\\nThou silver moon with softer gleam,\\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\\n2. \\nThou rushing wind that art so strong,\\nYe clouds that sail in heav'n along,\\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\\nThou rising morn, in praise rejoice;\\nYe light of evening, find a voice,\\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\\n3. \\nThou flowing water, pure and clear,\\nMake music for thy Lord to hear,\\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\\nThou fire so masterful and bright,\\nThat gives to man both warmth and light,\\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\\n4. \\nDear Mother Earth, who day by day\\nUnfoldest blessings on our way,\\nAlleluia!

remitted\\nAnd take his flesh and blood,\\nThat we may ever witness\\nThe suff'ring of thy Son,\\nAnd always have his Spirit\\nTo make our hearts as one.\\n3. \\nWhen Jesus, the Anointed,\\nDescended from above\\nAnd gave himself a ransom\\nTo win our souls with love'\\x80\\x94\\nWith no apparent beauty,\\nThat man should him desire'\\x80\\x94\\nHe was the promised Savior,\\nTo purify with

Saints be one.\\n1. \\nJesus of Nazareth,\\nSavior and King!\\nTriumphant over death,\\nLife thou didst bring,\\nLeaving thy Father's throne,\\nOn earth to live,\\nThy work to do alone,\\nThy life to give.\\n2. \\nWhile of this broken bread\\nHumbly we eat,\\nOur thoughts to thee are led\\nIn rev'rence sweet.\\nBruised, broken, torn for us\\nOn Calvary's hill'\\x80\\x94\\nThy suff'ring borne for us\\nLives with us still.\\n3. \\nAs to our lips the cup\\nGently we press,\\nOur hearts are lifted up;\\nThy name we bless!\\nGuide us where'er we go,\\nTill in the end\\nLife evermore we'll know\\nThrough thee, our Friend.\\n1. \\nWe'll sing all hail to Jesus' name,\\nAnd praise and honor give\\nTo him who bled on Calvary's hill\\nAnd died that we might live.\\n2. \\nHe passed the portals of the grave;\\nSalvation was his song;\\nHe called upon the sinbound soul\\nTo join the heav'nly throng.\\n3. \\nHe seized the keys of death and hell\\nAnd bruised the serpent's head;\\nHe bid the prison doors unfold,\\nThe grave yield up her dead.\\n4. \\nThe bread and water represent\\nHis sacrifice for sin;\\nYe Saints, partake and testify\\nYe do remember him.\\n1. \\nIn remembrance of thy suff'ring,\\nLord, these emblems we partake,\\nWhen thyself thou gav'st an off'ring,\\nDying for the sinner's sake.\\nWe've forgiven as thou biddest\\nAll who've trespassed against us.\\nLord, forgive, as we've forgiven,\\nAll thou seest amiss in us.\\n2. \\nPurify our hearts, our Savior;\\nLet us go not far astray,\\nThat we may be counted worthy\\nOf thy Spirit day by day.\\nWhen temptations are before us,\\nGive us strength to overcome.\\nAlways guard us in our wand'rings\\nTill we leave our earthly home.\\n3. \\nWhen thou comest in thy glory\\nTo this earth to rule and reign,\\nAnd with faithful ones partakest\\nOf the bread and wine again,\\nMay we be among the number\\nWorthy to surround the board,\\nAnd partake anew the emblems\\nOf the suff'rings of our Lord.\\n1. \\nUpon the cross of Calvary\\nThey crucified our Lord\\nAnd sealed with blood the sacrifice\\nThat sanctified his word.\\n2. \\nUpon the cross he meekly died\\nFor all mankind to see\\nThat death unlocks the passageway\\nInto eternity.\\n3. \\nUpon the cross our Savior died,\\nBut, dying, brought new birth\\nThrough resurrection's miracle\\nTo all the sons of earth.\\n1. \\nRev'rently and meekly now,\\nLet thy head most humbly bow.\\nThink of me, thou ransomed one;\\nThink what I for thee have done.\\nWith my blood that dripped like rain,\\nSweat in agony of pain,\\nWith my body on the tree\\nI have ransomed even thee.\\n2. \\nIn this bread now blest for thee,\\nEmblem of my body see;\\nIn this water or this wine,\\nEmblem of my blood divine.\\nOh, remember what was done\\nThat the sinner might be won.\\nOn the cross of Calvary\\nI have suffered death for thee.\\n3. \\nBid thine heart all strife to cease;\\nWith thy brethren be at peace.\\nOh, forgive as thou wouldst be\\nE'en forgiven now by me.\\nIn the solemn faith of prayer\\nCast upon me all thy care,\\nAnd my Spirit's grace shall be\\nLike a fountain unto thee.\\n4. \\nAt the throne I intercede;\\nFor thee ever do I plead.\\nI have loved thee as thy friend,\\nWith a love that cannot end.\\nBe obedient, I implore,\\nPrayerful, watchful evermore,\\nAnd be constant unto me,\\nThat thy Savior I may be.\\n1. \\nAgain we meet around the board\\nOf Jesus, our redeeming Lord,\\nWith faith in his atoning blood,\\nOur only access unto God.\\n2. \\nHe left his Father's courts on high,\\nWith man to live, for man to die,\\nA world to purchase and to save\\nAnd seal a triumph o'er the grave.\\n3. \\nHelp us, O God, to realize\\nThe great atoning sacrifice,\\nThe gift of thy beloved Son,\\nThe Prince of Life, the Holy One.\\n4. \\nOh, bless us, Lord, for Jesus' sake,\\nThat we may worthily partake\\nThese emblems of the flesh and blood\\nOf our Redeemer, Savior, God.\\n1. \\nGod loved us, so he sent his Son,\\nChrist Jesus, the atoning One,\\nTo show us by the path he trod\\nThe one and only way to God.\\n2. \\nHe came as man, though Son of God,\\nAnd bowed himself beneath the rod.\\nHe died in holy innocence,\\nA broken law to recompense.\\n3. \\nOh, love effulgent, love divine!\\nWhat debt of gratitude is mine,\\nThat in his off'ring I have part\\nAnd hold a place within his heart.\\n4. \\nIn word and deed he doth require\\nMy will to his, like son to sire,\\nBe made to bend, and I, as son,\\nLearn conduct from the Holy One.\\n5. \\nThis sacrament doth represent\\nHis blood and body for me spent.\\nPartaking now is deed for word\\nThat I remember him, my Lord.\\n1. \\nWhen in the wondrous realms above\\nOur Savior had been called upon\\nTo save our world of sin by love,\\nHe said, '\\x80\\x9cThy will, O Lord, be done.'\\x80\\x9d\\n2. \\nThe King of Kings left worlds of light,\\nBecame the meek and lowly One;\\nIn brightest day or darkest night,\\nHe said, '\\x80\\x9cThy will, O Lord, be done.'\\x80\\x9d\\n3. \\nNo crown of thorns, no cruel cross\\nCould make our great Redeemer shun.\\nHe counted his own will but naught,\\nAnd said, '\\x80\\x9cThy will, O Lord, be done.'\\x80\\x9d\\n4. \\nWe take the bread and cup this day\\nIn mem'ry of the sinless One,\\nAnd pray for strength, that we may say,\\nAs he, '\\x80\\x9cThy will, O Lord, be done.'\\x80\\x9d\\n1. \\nO thou, before the world began,\\nOrdained a sacrifice for man,\\nAnd by th'eternal Spirit made\\nAn off'ring in the sinner's stead;\\nOur everlasting Priest art thou,\\nPleading thy death for sinners now.\\n2. \\nThy off'ring still continues new\\nBefore the righteous Father's view.\\nThyself the Lamb forever slain;\\nThy priesthood doth unchanged remain.\\nThy years, O God, can never fail,\\nNor thy blest work within the veil.\\n3. \\nOh, that our faith may never move\\nBut stand unshaken as thy love,\\nSure evidence of things unseen;\\nNow let it pass the years between\\nAnd view thee bleeding on the tree:\\nMy Lord, my God, who dies for me.\\n1. \\nIn mem'ry of the Crucified,\\nOur Father, we have met this hour.\\nMay thy sweet Spirit here abide,\\nThat all may feel its glowing pow'r.\\n2. \\nOur Savior, in Gethsemane,\\nShrank not to drink the bitter cup,\\nAnd then, for us, on Calvary,\\nUpon the cross was lifted up.\\n3. \\nWe rev'rence with the broken bread,\\nTogether with the cup we take,\\nThe body bruised, the lifeblood shed,\\nA sinless ransom for our sake.\\n4. \\nOur Father, may this sacrament\\nTo ev'ry soul be sanctified\\nWho eats and drinks with pure intent,\\nThat in our Savior he'll abide.\\n1. \\nBehold the great Redeemer die,\\nA broken law to satisfy.\\nHe dies a sacrifice for sin,\\nHe dies a sacrifice for sin,\\nThat man may live and glory win.\\n2. \\nWhile guilty men his pains deride,\\nThey pierce his hands and feet and side;\\nAnd with insulting scoffs and scorns,\\nAnd with insulting scoffs and scorns,\\nThey crown his head with plaited thorns.\\n3. \\nAlthough in agony he hung,\\nNo murm'ring word escaped his tongue.\\nHis high commission to fulfill,\\nHis high commission to fulfill,\\nHe magnified his Father's will.\\n4. \\n'\\x80\\x9cFather, from me remove this cup.\\nYet, if thou wilt, I'll drink it up.\\nI've done the work thou gavest me,\\nI've done the work thou gavest me;\\nReceive my spirit unto thee.'\\x80\\x9d\\n5. \\nHe died, and at the awful sight\\nThe sun in shame withdrew its light!\\nEarth trembled, and all nature sighed,\\nEarth trembled, and all nature sighed\\nIn dread response, '\\x80\\x9cA God has died!'\\x80\\x9d\\n6. \\nHe lives'\\x80\\x94he lives. We humbly now\\nAround these sacred symbols bow\\nAnd seek, as Saints of latter days,\\nAnd seek, as Saints of latter days,\\nTo do his will and live his praise.\\n1. \\nHe died! The great Redeemer died,\\nAnd Israel's daughters wept around.\\nA solemn darkness veiled the sky;\\nA sudden trembling shook the ground.\\n2. \\nCome, Saints, and drop a tear or two\\nFor him who groaned beneath your load;\\nHe shed a thousand drops for you,\\nA thousand drops of precious blood.\\n3. \\nHere's love and grief beyond degree;\\nThe Lord of glory died for men.\\nBut lo! what sudden joys were heard!\\nThe Lord, though dead, revived again.\\n4. \\nThe rising Lord forsook the tomb.\\nIn vain the tomb forbade him rise.\\nCherubic legions guard him home\\nAnd shout him welcome to the skies.\\n1. \\nI stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,\\nConfused at the grace that so fully he proffers me.\\nI tremble to know that for me he was crucified,\\nThat for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.\\n2. \\nI marvel that he would descend from his throne divine\\nTo rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine,\\nThat he should extend his great love unto such as I,\\nSufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.\\n3. \\nI think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!\\nSuch mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?\\nNo, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,\\nUntil at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.\\n1. \\nThere is a green hill far away,\\nWithout a city wall,\\nWhere the dear Lord was crucified,\\nWho died to save us all.\\n2. \\nWe may not know, we cannot tell,\\nWhat pains he had to bear,\\nBut we believe it was for us\\nHe hung and suffered there.\\n3. \\nThere was no other good enough\\nTo pay the price of sin.\\nHe only could unlock the gate\\nOf heav'n and let us in.\\n4. \\nOh, dearly, dearly has he loved!\\nAnd we must love him too,\\nAnd trust in his redeeming blood,\\nAnd try his works to do.\\n1. \\nHow great the wisdom and the love\\nThat filled the courts on high\\nAnd sent the Savior from above\\nTo suffer, bleed, and die!\\n2. \\nHis precious blood he freely spilt;\\nHis life he freely gave,\\nA sinless sacrifice for guilt,\\nA dying world to save.\\n3. \\nBy strict obedience Jesus won\\nThe prize with glory rife:\\n'\\x80\\x9cThy will, O God, not mine be done,'\\x80\\x9d\\nAdorned his mortal life.\\n4. \\nHe marked the path and led the way,\\nAnd ev'ry point defines\\nTo light and life and endless day\\nWhere God's full presence shines.\\n5. \\nIn mem'ry of the broken flesh\\nWe eat the broken bread\\nAnd witness with the cup, afresh,\\nOur faith in Christ, our Head.\\n6. \\nHow great, how glorious, how complete\\nRedemption's grand design,\\nWhere justice, love, and mercy meet\\nIn harmony divine!\\n1. \\nJesus, once of humble birth,\\nNow in glory comes to earth.\\nOnce he suffered grief and pain;\\nNow he comes on earth to reign.\\nNow he comes on earth to reign.\\n2. \\nOnce a meek and lowly Lamb,\\nNow the Lord, the great I Am.\\nOnce upon the cross he bowed;\\nNow his chariot is the cloud.\\nNow his chariot is the cloud.\\n3. \\nOnce he groaned in blood and tears;\\nNow in glory he appears.\\nOnce rejected by his own,\\nNow their King he shall be known.\\nNow their King he shall be known.\\n4. \\nOnce forsaken, left alone,\\nNow exalted to a throne.\\nOnce all things he meekly bore,\\nBut he now will bear no more.\\nBut he now will bear no more.\\n1. \\nO Savior, thou who wearest\\nA crown of piercing thorn,\\nThe pain thou meekly bearest,\\nWeigh'd down by grief and scorn.\\nThe soldiers mock and flail thee;\\nFor drink they give thee gall;\\nUpon the cross they nail thee\\nTo die, O King of all.\\n2. \\nNo creature is so lowly,\\nNo sinner so depraved,\\nBut feels thy presence holy\\nAnd thru thy love is saved.\\nTho craven friends betray thee,\\nThey feel thy love's embrace;\\nThe very foes who slay thee\\nHave access to thy grace.\\n3. \\nThy sacrifice transcended\\nThe mortal law's demand;\\nThy mercy is extended\\nTo ev'ry time and land.\\nNo more can Satan harm us,\\nTho long the fight may be,\\nNor fear of death alarm us;\\nWe live, O Lord, thru thee.\\n4. \\nWhat praises can we offer\\nTo thank thee, Lord most high?\\nIn our place thou didst suffer;\\nIn our place thou didst die,\\nBy heaven's plan appointed,\\nTo ransom us, our King.\\nO Jesus, the anointed,\\nTo thee our love we bring!\\n1. \\nThat Easter morn, a grave that burst\\nProclaimed to man that '\\x80\\x9cLast and First'\\x80\\x9d\\nHad ris'n again\\nAnd conquered pain.\\n2. \\nThis morn renews for us that day\\nWhen Jesus cast the bonds away,\\nTook living breath\\nAnd conquered death.\\n3. \\nThus we in gratitude recall\\nAnd give our love and pledge our all,\\nShed grateful tear\\nAnd conquer fear.\\n1. \\nHe is risen! He is risen!\\nTell it out with joyful voice.\\nHe has burst his three days' prison;\\nLet the whole wide earth rejoice.\\nDeath is conquered; man is free.\\nChrist has won the victory.\\n2. \\nCome with high and holy hymning;\\nChant our Lord's triumphant lay.\\nNot one darksome cloud is dimming\\nYonder glorious morning ray,\\nBreaking o'er the purple east,\\nSymbol of our Easter feast.\\n3. \\nHe is risen! He is risen!\\nHe hath opened heaven's gate.\\nWe are free from sin's dark prison,\\nRisen to a holier state.\\nAnd a brighter Easter beam\\nOn our longing eyes shall stream.\\n1. \\nChrist the Lord is ris'n today,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nSons of men and angels say,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nRaise your joys and triumphs high,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nSing, ye heav'ns, and earth reply,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\n2. \\nLove's redeeming work is done,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nFought the fight, the vict'ry won,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nJesus' agony is o'er,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nDarkness veils the earth no more,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\n3. \\nLives again our glorious King,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nWhere, O death, is now thy sting?Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nOnce he died our souls to save,Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\nWhere thy victory, O grave?Â\\xa0Alleluia!\\n1. \\nJoy to the world, the Lord is come;\\nLet earth receive her King!\\nLet ev'ry heart prepare him room,\\nAnd Saints and angels sing,\\nAnd Saints and angels sing,\\nAnd Saints, and Saints and angels sing.\\n2. \\nRejoice! Rejoice when Jesus reigns,\\nAnd Saints their songs employ,\\nWhile fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains\\nRepeat the sounding joy,\\nRepeat the sounding joy,\\nRepeat, repeat the sounding joy.\\n3. \\nNo more will sin and sorrow grow,\\nNor thorns infest the ground;\\nHe'll come and make the blessings flow\\nFar as the curse was found,\\nFar as the curse was found,\\nFar as, far as the curse was found.\\n4. \\nRejoice! Rejoice in the Most High,\\nWhile Israel spreads abroad\\nLike stars that glitter in the sky,\\nAnd ever worship God,\\nAnd ever worship God,\\nAnd ever, and ever worship God.\\n1. \\nOh, come, all ye faithful,\\nJoyful and triumphant!\\nOh, come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem.\\nCome and behold him,\\nBorn the King of angels;\\n2. \\n'\\x80\\x94 Sing, choirs of angels,\\nSing in exultation;\\n'\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0Sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above!\\nGlory to God,\\nGlory in the highest;\\n3. \\n'\\x80\\x94 Yea, Lord, we greet thee,\\nBorn this happy morning;\\n'\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0Jesus, to thee be all glory giv'n.\\nSon of the Father,\\nNow in flesh appearing;\\n1. \\nAngels we have heard on high\\nSweetly singing o'er the plains,\\nAnd the mountains in reply\\nEchoing their joyous strains.\\n2. \\nShepherds, why this jubilee?\\nWhy your joyous strains prolong?\\nWhat the gladsome tidings be\\nWhich inspire your heav'nly song?\\n3. \\nCome to Bethlehem and see\\nHim whose birth the angels sing;\\nCome, adore on bended knee\\nChrist the Lord, the newborn King.\\n1. \\nSilent night! Holy night!\\nAll is calm, all is bright\\nRound yon virgin mother and Child.\\nHoly Infant, so tender and mild,\\nSleep in heavenly peace;\\nSleep in heavenly peace.\\n2. \\nSilent night! Holy night!\\nShepherds quake at the sight!\\nGlories stream from heaven afar;\\nHeav'nly hosts sing Alleluia!\\nChrist, the Savior, is born!\\nChrist, the Savior, is born!\\n3. \\nSilent night! Holy night!\\nSon of God, love's pure light\\nRadiant beams from thy holy face,\\nWith the dawn of redeeming grace,\\nJesus, Lord, at thy birth;\\nJesus, Lord, at thy birth.\\n1. \\nOnce in royal David's city\\nStood a lowly cattle shed,\\nWhere a mother laid her baby\\nIn a manger for his bed:\\nMary was that mother mild,\\nJesus Christ her little child.\\n2. \\nHe came down to earth from heaven,\\nWho is God and Lord of all,\\nAnd his shelter was a stable,\\nAnd his cradle was a stall;\\nWith the poor, and mean, and lowly,\\nLived on earth our Savior holy.\\n3. \\nAnd our eyes at last shall see him,\\nThrough his own redeeming love;\\nFor that child so dear and gentle\\nIs our Lord in heav'n above,\\nAnd he leads his children on\\nTo the place where he is gone.\\n1. \\nAway in a manger, no crib for his bed,\\nThe little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head;\\nThe stars in the heavens looked down where he lay,\\nThe little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.\\n2. \\nThe cattle are lowing; the poor baby wakes,\\nBut little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.\\nI love thee, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky\\nAnd stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.\\n3. \\nBe near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay\\nClose by me forever, and love me, I pray.\\nBless all the dear children in thy tender care,\\nAnd fit us for heaven to live with thee there.\\n1. \\nIt came upon the midnight clear,\\nThat glorious song of old,\\nFrom angels bending near the earth\\nTo touch their harps of gold:\\n'\\x80\\x9cPeace on the earth, good will to men\\nFrom heav'n's all-gracious King.'\\x80\\x9d\\nThe world in solemn stillness lay\\nTo hear the angels sing.\\n2. \\nStill thru the cloven skies they come\\nWith peaceful wings unfurled,\\nAnd still their heav'nly music floats\\nO'er all the weary world.\\nAbove its sad and lowly plains\\nThey bend on hov'ring wing,\\nAnd ever o'er its babel sounds\\nThe blessed angels sing.\\n3. \\nFor lo! the days are hast'ning on,\\nBy prophets seen of old,\\nWhen with the ever-circling years\\nShall come the time foretold,\\nWhen the new heav'n and earth shall own\\nThe Prince of Peace their King,\\nAnd the whole world send back the song\\nWhich now the angels sing.\\n1. \\nO little town of Bethlehem,\\nHow still we see thee lie.\\nAbove thy deep and dreamless sleep\\nThe silent stars go by;\\nYet in thy dark streets shineth\\nThe everlasting Light.\\nThe hopes and fears of all the years\\nAre met in thee tonight.\\n2. \\nFor Christ is born of Mary,\\nAnd, gathered all above\\nWhile mortals sleep, the angels keep\\nTheir watch of wond'ring love.\\nO morning stars, together\\nProclaim the holy birth,\\nAnd praises sing to God the King,\\nAnd peace to men on earth.\\n3. \\nHow silently, how silently\\nThe wondrous gift is giv'n!\\nSo God imparts to human hearts\\nThe blessings of his heav'n.\\nNo ear may hear his coming;\\nBut in this world of sin,\\nWhere meek souls will receive him, still\\nThe dear Christ enters in.\\n1. \\nHark! the herald angels sing\\nGlory to the newborn King!\\nPeace on earth and mercy mild,\\nGod and sinners reconciled!\\nJoyful, all ye nations, rise;\\nJoin the triumph of the skies;\\nWith th'angelic host proclaim\\nChrist is born in Bethlehem!\\n2. \\nHail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!\\nHail the Son of Righteousness!\\nLight and life to all he brings,\\nRis'n with healing in his wings.\\nMild he lays his glory by,\\nBorn that man no more may die;\\nBorn to raise the sons of earth,\\nBorn to give them second birth.\\n1. \\nWith wond'ring awe the wisemen saw\\nThe star in heaven springing,\\nAnd with delight, in peaceful night,\\nThey heard the angels singing:\\n2. \\nBy light of star they traveled far\\nTo seek the lowly manger,\\nA humble bed wherein was laid\\nThe wondrous little Stranger.\\n3. \\nAnd still is found, the world around,\\nThe old and hallowed story,\\nAnd still is sung in ev'ry tongue\\nThe angels' song of glory:\\n4. \\nThe heav'nly star its rays afar\\nOn ev'ry land is throwing,\\nAnd shall not cease till holy peace\\nIn all the earth is growing.\\n1. \\nWhile shepherds watch'd their flocks by night,\\nAll seated on the ground,\\nThe angel of the Lord came down,\\nAnd glory shone around.\\n'\\x80\\x9cFear not,'\\x80\\x9d said he, for mighty dread\\nHad seized their troubled mind;\\n'\\x80\\x9cGlad tidings of great joy I bring\\nTo you and all mankind.'\\x80\\x9d\\n2. \\n'\\x80\\x9cTo you, in David's town this day,\\nIs born of David's line\\nThe Savior who is Christ the Lord,\\nAnd this shall be the sign:\\nThe heav'nly Babe you there shall find\\nTo human view displayed,\\nAll meanly wrapped in swathing bands,\\nAnd in a manger laid.'\\x80\\x9d\\n3. \\nThus spake the seraph, and forthwith\\nAppeared a shining throng\\nOf angels praising God, who thus\\nAddressed their joyful song:\\n'\\x80\\x9cAll glory be to God on high\\nAnd on the earth be peace.\\nGoodwill henceforth from heav'n to men\\nBegin and never cease.'\\x80\\x9d\\n1. \\nFar, far away on Judea's plains,\\nShepherds of old heard the joyous strains:\\n2. \\nSweet are these strains of redeeming love,\\nMessage of mercy from heav'n above:\\n3. \\nLord, with the angels we too would rejoice;\\nHelp us to sing with the heart and voice:\\n4. \\nHasten the time when, from ev'ry clime,\\nMen shall unite in the strains sublime:\\n1. \\nThe first Noel the angel did say\\nWas to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay,\\nIn fields where they lay keeping their sheep\\nOn a cold winter's night that was so deep.\\n2. \\nThey looked up and saw a star\\nShining in the East beyond them far,\\nAnd to the earth it gave great light,\\nAnd so it continued both day and night.\\n1. \\nI heard the bells on Christmas day\\nTheir old familiar carols play,\\nAnd wild and sweet the words repeat\\nOf peace on earth, good will to men.\\n2. \\nI thought how, as the day had come,\\nThe belfries of all Christendom\\nHad rolled along th'unbroken song\\nOf peace on earth, good will to men.\\n3. \\nAnd in despair I bowed my head:\\n'\\x80\\x9cThere is no peace on earth,'\\x80\\x9d I said,\\n'\\x80\\x9cFor hate is strong and mocks the song\\nOf peace on earth, good will to men.'\\x80\\x9d\\n4. \\nThen pealed the bells more loud and deep:\\n'\\x80\\x9cGod is not dead, nor doth he sleep;\\nThe wrong shall fail, the right prevail,\\nWith peace on earth, good will to men.'\\x80\\x9d\\n5. \\nTill, ringing, singing, on its way,\\nThe world revolved from night to day,\\nA voice, a chime, a chant sublime,\\nOf peace on earth, good will to men!\\n1. \\nRing out, wild bells, to the wild sky,\\nThe flying cloud, the frosty light.\\nThe year is dying in the night;\\nRing out, wild bells, and let him die.\\nThe year is dying in the night;\\nRing out, wild bells, and let him die.\\n2. \\nRing out the old; ring in the new.\\nRing, happy bells, across the snow.\\nThe year is going; let him go.\\nRing out the false; ring in the true.\\nThe year is going; let him go.\\nRing out the false; ring in the true.\\n3. \\nRing in the valiant men and free,\\nThe larger heart, the kindlier hand.\\nRing out the darkness of the land;\\nRing in the Christ that is to be.\\nRing out the darkness of the land;\\nRing in the Christ that is to be.\\n1. \\nWe are sowing, daily sowing\\nCountless seeds of good and ill,\\nScattered on the level lowland,\\nCast upon the windy hill;\\nSeeds that sink in rich, brown furrows,\\nSoft with heaven's gracious rain;\\nSeeds that rest upon the surface\\nOf the dry, unyielding plain;\\n2. \\nSeeds that fall amid the stillness\\nOf the lonely mountain glen;\\nSeeds cast out in crowded places,\\nTrodden under foot of men;\\nSeeds by idle hearts forgotten,\\nFlung at random on the air;\\nSeeds by faithful souls remembered,\\nSown in tears and love and prayer;\\n3. \\nSeeds that lie unchanged, unquickened,\\nLifeless on the teeming mold;\\nSeeds that live and grow and flourish\\nWhen the sower's hand is cold.\\nBy a whisper sow we blessings;\\nBy a breath we scatter strife.\\nIn our words and thoughts and actions\\nLie the seeds of death and life.\\n4. \\nThou who knowest all our weakness,\\nLeave us not to sow alone!\\nBid thine angels guard the furrows\\nWhere the precious grain is sown,\\nTill the fields are crown'd with glory,\\nFilled with mellow, ripened ears,\\nFilled with fruit of life eternal\\nFrom the seed we sowed in tears.\\n1. \\nCome, let us anew our journey pursue,\\nRoll round with the year,\\nAnd never stand still till the Master appear.\\nHis adorable will let us gladly fulfill,\\nAnd our talents improve\\nBy the patience of hope and the labor of love,\\nBy the patience of hope and the labor of love.\\n2. \\nOur life as a dream, our time as a stream\\nGlide swiftly away,\\nAnd the fugitive moment refuses to stay;\\nFor the arrow is flown and the moments are gone.\\nThe millennial year\\nPresses on to our view, and eternity's here,\\nPresses on to our view, and eternity's here.\\n3. \\nOh, that each in the day of His coming may say,\\n'\\x80\\x9cI have fought my way thru;\\nI have finished the work thou didst give me to do.'\\x80\\x9d\\nOh, that each from his Lord may receive the glad word:\\n'\\x80\\x9cWell and faithfully done;\\nEnter into my joy and sit down on my throne;\\nEnter into my joy and sit down on my throne.'\\x80\\x9d\\n1. \\nWe give thee but thine own,\\nWhate'er the gift may be,\\nFor all we have is thine alone,\\nA trust, O Lord, from thee.\\n2. \\nMay we thy bounties thus\\nAs stewards true receive,\\nAnd gladly, as thou blessest us,\\nTo thee our firstfruits give.\\n3. \\nTo comfort and to bless,\\nTo find a balm for woe,\\nTo tend the lone and fatherless\\nIs angels' work below.\\n4. \\nAnd we believe thy word,\\nTho dim our faith may be;\\nWhate'er we do for thine, O Lord,\\nWe do it unto thee.\\n1. \\nSavior, may I learn to love thee,\\nWalk the path that thou hast shown,\\nPause to help and lift another,\\nFinding strength beyond my own.\\nSavior, may I learn to love thee'\\x80\\x94\\nLord, I would follow thee.\\n2. \\nWho am I to judge another\\nWhen I walk imperfectly?\\nIn the quiet heart is hidden\\nSorrow that the eye can't see.\\nWho am I to judge another?\\nLord, I would follow thee.\\n3. \\nI would be my brother's keeper;\\nI would learn the healer's art.\\nTo the wounded and the weary\\nI would show a gentle heart.\\nI would be my brother's keeper'\\x80\\x94\\nLord, I would follow thee.\\n4. \\nSavior, may I love my brother\\nAs I know thou lovest me,\\nFind in thee my strength, my beacon,\\nFor thy servant I would be.\\nSavior, may I love my brother'\\x80\\x94\\nLord, I would follow thee.\\n1. \\nDear to the heart of the Shepherd,\\nDear are the sheep of his fold;\\nDear is the love that he gives them,\\nDearer than silver or gold.\\nDear to the heart of the Shepherd,\\nDear are his '\\x80\\x9cother'\\x80\\x9d lost sheep;\\nOver the mountains he follows,\\nOver the waters so deep.\\n2. \\nDear to the heart of the Shepherd,\\nDear are the lambs of his fold;\\nSome from the pastures are straying,\\nHungry and helpless and cold.\\nSee, the Good Shepherd is seeking,\\nSeeking the lambs that are lost,\\nBringing them in with rejoicing,\\nSaved at such infinite cost.\\n3. \\nDear to the heart of the Shepherd,\\nDear are the '\\x80\\x9cninety and nine'\\x80\\x9d;\\nDear are the sheep that have wandered\\nOut in the desert to pine.\\nHark! he is earnestly calling,\\nTenderly pleading today:\\n'\\x80\\x9cWill you not seek for my lost ones,\\nOff from my shelter astray?'\\x80\\x9d\\n4. \\nGreen are the pastures inviting;\\nSweet are the waters and still.\\nLord, we will answer thee gladly,\\n'\\x80\\x9cYes, blessed Master, we will!\\nMake us thy true under-shepherds;\\nGive us a love that is deep.\\nSend us out into the desert,\\nSeeking thy wandering sheep.'\\x80\\x9d\\n1. \\nHear thou our hymn, O Lord,\\nWith thankful hearts we pray.\\nHelp us thy will to follow now,\\nAnd walk the narrow way.\\n2. \\nKeep thou our hearts aglow\\nWith thy eternal word.\\nGive us thy Spirit ev'ry hour,\\nWe ask thee, gracious Lord.\\n1. \\nHave I done any good in the world today?\\nHave I helped anyone in need?\\nHave I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?\\nIf not, I have failed indeed.\\nHas anyone's burden been lighter today\\nBecause I was willing to share?\\nHave the sick and the weary been helped on their way?\\nWhen they needed my help was I there?\\n2. \\nThere are chances for work all around just now,\\nOpportunities right in our way.\\nDo not let them pass by, saying, '\\x80\\x9cSometime I'll try,'\\x80\\x9d\\nBut go and do something today.\\n'Tis noble of man to work and to give;\\nLove's labor has merit alone.\\nOnly he who does something helps others to live.\\nTo God each good work will be known.\\n1. \\nI have work enough to do,\\nEre the sun goes down,\\nFor myself and kindred too,\\nEre the sun goes down:\\nEv'ry idle whisper stilling\\nWith a purpose firm and willing,\\nAll my daily tasks fulfilling,\\nEre the sun goes down.\\n2. \\nI must speak the loving word,\\nEre the sun goes down.\\nI must let my voice be heard,\\nEre the sun goes down:\\nEv'ry cry of pity heeding,\\nFor the injured interceding,\\nTo the light the lost ones leading,\\nEre the sun goes down.\\n3. \\nAs I journey on my way,\\nEre the sun goes down,\\nGod's commands I must obey,\\nEre the sun goes down.\\nThere are sins that need confessing;\\nThere are wrongs that need redressing\\nIf I would obtain the blessing,\\nEre the sun goes down.\\n1. \\nWe are marching on to glory;\\nWe are working for our crown.\\nWe will make our armor brighter\\nAnd never lay it down.\\n2. \\nThen day by day we are marching;\\nTo heaven we are bound.\\nEach good act brings us nearer\\nThat home where we'll be crowned.\\n3. \\nThen, with the ransomed children\\nThat throng the starry throne,\\nWe will praise our Lord and Savior,\\nHis pow'r and mercy own.\\n1. \\nImprove the shining moments;\\nDon't let them pass you by.\\nWork while the sun is radiant;\\nWork, for the night draws nigh.\\nWe cannot bid the sunbeams\\nTo lengthen out their stay,\\nNor can we ask the shadow\\nTo ever stay away.\\n2. \\nTime flies on wings of lightning;\\nWe cannot call it back.\\nIt comes, then passes forward\\nAlong its onward track.\\nAnd if we are not mindful,\\nThe chance will fade away,\\nFor life is quick in passing.\\n'Tis as a single day.\\n3. \\nAs wintertime doth follow\\nThe pleasant summer days,\\nSo may our joys all vanish\\nAnd pass far from our gaze.\\nThen should we not endeavor\\nEach day some point to gain,\\nThat we may here be useful\\nAnd ev'ry wrong disdain?\\n4. \\nImprove each shining moment.\\nIn this you are secure,\\nFor promptness bringeth safety\\nAnd blessings rich and pure.\\nLet prudence guide your actions;\\nBe honest in your heart;\\nAnd God will love and bless you\\nAnd help to you impart.\\n1. \\nThere is sunshine in my soul today,\\nMore glorious and bright\\nThan glows in any earthly sky,\\nFor Jesus is my light.\\n2. \\nThere is music in my soul today,\\nA carol to my King,\\nAnd Jesus listening can hear\\nThe songs I cannot sing.\\n3. \\nThere is springtime in my soul today,\\nFor when the Lord is near,\\nThe dove of peace sings in my heart,\\nThe flow'rs of grace appear.\\n4. \\nThere is gladness in my soul today,\\nAnd hope and praise and love,\\nFor blessings which he gives me now,\\nFor joys '\\x80\\x9claid up'\\x80\\x9d above.\\n1. \\nYou can make the pathway bright,\\nFill the soul with heaven's light,\\nIf there's sunshine in your heart;\\nTurning darkness into day,\\nAs the shadows fly away,\\nIf there's sunshine in your heart today.\\n2. \\nYou can speak the gentle word\\nTo the heart with anger stirred,\\nIf there's sunshine in your heart;\\nTho it seems a little thing,\\nIt will heaven's blessings bring,\\nIf there's sunshine in your heart today.\\n3. \\nYou can do a kindly deed\\nTo your neighbor in his need,\\nIf there's sunshine in your heart;\\nAnd his burden you will share\\nAs you lift his load of care,\\nIf there's sunshine in your heart today.\\n4. \\nYou can live a happy life\\nIn this world of toil and strife,\\nIf there's sunshine in your heart;\\nAnd your soul will glow with love\\nFrom the perfect Light above,\\nIf there's sunshine in your heart today.\\n1. \\nToday, while the sun shines, work

gold,\\nThe peace and the joy that are found in the fold.\\nToday seek the gems that shine in the heart;\\nWhile here we labor, choose the better part.\\n3. \\nToday seek for goodness, virtue, and truth,\\nAs crown of your life and the grace of your youth.\\nToday, while the heart beats, live to be true,\\nConstant and faithful all the way through.\\n1. \\nIn a world where sorrow\\nEver will be known,\\nWhere are found the needy\\nAnd the sad and lone,\\nHow much joy and comfort\\nYou can all bestow,\\nIf you scatter sunshine\\nEv'rywhere you go.\\n2. \\nSlightest actions often\\nMeet the sorest needs,\\nFor the world wants daily\\nLittle kindly deeds.\\nOh, what care and sorrow\\nYou may help remove,\\nWith your songs and courage,\\nSympathy and love.\\n3. \\nWhen the days are gloomy,\\nSing some happy song;\\nMeet the world's repining\\nWith a courage strong.\\nGo with faith undaunted\\nThru the ills of life;\\nScatter smiles and sunshine\\nO'er its toil and strife.\\n1. \\nFather, cheer our souls tonight;\\nLift our burdens, make them light.\\nLet thine all-pervading love\\nShine upon us from above.\\n2. \\nCalm the surges of the soul;\\nBid the dark waves backward roll.\\nLet us all thy mercies feel\\nThru the pow'r thou dost reveal.\\n3. \\nBless our loved ones far away;\\nGrant them health and peace, we pray.\\nIn their hearts let holy light\\nBeam to guide their steps aright.\\n4. \\nLet implicit faith and trust\\nHelp us know thy ways are just.\\nMay thine ever-tender love\\nLead our hearts to thee above.\\n1. \\nLet us oft speak kind words to each other\\nAt home or where'er we may be;\\nLike the warblings of birds on the heather,\\nThe tones will be welcome and free.\\nThey'll gladden the heart that's repining,\\nGive courage and hope from above,\\nAnd where the dark clouds hide the shining,\\nLet in the bright sunlight of love.\\n2. \\nLike the sunbeams of morn on the mountains,\\nThe soul they awake to good cheer;\\nLike the murmur of cool, pleasant fountains,\\nThey fall in sweet cadences near.\\nLet's oft, then, in kindly toned voices,\\nOur mutual friendship renew,\\nTill heart meets with heart and rejoices\\nIn friendship that ever is true.\\n1. \\nNay, speak no ill; a kindly word\\nCan never leave a sting behind;\\nAnd, oh, to breathe each tale we've heard\\nIs far beneath a noble mind.\\nFull oft a better seed is sown\\nBy choosing thus the kinder plan,\\nFor, if but little good is known,\\nStill let us speak the best we can.\\n2. \\nGive me the heart that fain would hide,\\nWould fain another's faults efface.\\nHow can it please the human pride\\nTo prove humanity but base?\\nNo, let us reach a higher mood,\\nA nobler estimate of man;\\nBe earnest in the search for good,\\nAnd speak of all the best we can.\\n3. \\nThen speak no ill, but lenient be\\nTo others' failings as your own.\\nIf you're the first a fault to see,\\nBe not the first to make it known,\\nFor life is but a passing day;\\nNo lip may tell how brief its span.\\nThen, oh, the little time we stay,\\nLet's speak of all the best we can.\\n1. \\nJesus, mighty King in Zion,\\nThou alone our guide shalt be.\\nThy commission we rely on;\\nWe will follow none but thee.\\n2. \\nAs an emblem of thy passion\\nAnd thy vict'ry o'er the grave,\\nWe, who know thy great salvation,\\nAre baptized beneath the wave.\\n3. \\nFearless of the world's despising,\\nWe the ancient path pursue,\\nBuried with the Lord and rising\\nTo a life divinely new.\\n1. \\nShould you feel inclined to censure\\nFaults you may in others view,\\nAsk your own heart, ere you venture,\\nIf you have not failings, too.\\nLet not friendly vows be broken;\\nRather strive a friend to gain.\\nMany words in anger spoken\\nFind their passage home again.\\n2. \\nDo not, then, in idle pleasure\\nTrifle with a brother's fame;\\nGuard it as a valued treasure,\\nSacred as your own good name.\\nDo not form opinions blindly;\\nHastiness to trouble tends;\\nThose of whom we thought unkindly\\nOft become our warmest friends.\\n1. \\nLord, accept into thy kingdom\\nEach repentant, humbled one,\\nBorn of water and the Spirit\\nIn thy name, Beloved Son.\\nLet the Holy Ghost, descending,\\nComfort, guide the path of youth,\\nChannel of all light and glory,\\nKey to vision, knowledge, truth.\\n2. \\nKnow ye not that he was holy?\\nYet he witnessed unto men\\nThat the way is straight and narrow\\nLeading unto God again.\\nHark, glad tidings of salvation.\\nHear his word, '\\x80\\x9cCome, follow me\\nUnto glory in my kingdom,\\nUnto life eternally.'\\x80\\x9d\\n3. \\nLike the sound of rushing waters\\nIn this day his word is said:\\nHoly ordinance of mercy\\nFor the living and the dead!\\nLet your hearts rejoice in gladness!\\nLet the earth break forth and sing!\\nLet the dead speak praising anthems\\nTo our God, eternal King!\\n1. \\nDo what is right; the day-dawn is breaking,\\nHailing a future of freedom and light.\\nAngels above us are silent notes taking\\nOf ev'ry action; then do what is right!\\n2. \\nDo what is right; the shackles are falling.\\nChains of the bondsmen no longer are bright;\\nLightened by hope, soon they'll cease to be galling.\\nTruth goeth onward; then do what is right!\\n3. \\nDo what is right; be faithful and fearless.\\nOnward, press onward, the goal is in sight.\\nEyes that are wet now, ere long will be tearless.\\nBlessings await you in doing what's right!\\n1. \\nBehold thy sons and daughters, Lord,\\nOn whom we lay our hands.\\nThey have fulfilled the gospel word\\nAnd bowed at thy commands.\\n2. \\nOh, now send down the heav'nly dove\\nAnd overwhelm their souls\\nWith peace and joy and perfect love,\\nAs lambs within thy fold.\\n3. \\nSeal them by thine own Spirit's pow'r,\\nWhich purifies from sin,\\nAnd may they find, from this good hour,\\nThey are adopted in.\\n4. \\nIncrease their faith, confirm their hope,\\nAnd guide them in the way.\\nWith comfort bear their spirits up\\nUntil the perfect day.\\n1. \\nChoose the right when a choice is placed before you.\\nIn the right the Holy Spirit guides;\\nAnd its light is forever shining o'er you,\\nWhen in the right your heart confides.\\n2. \\nChoose the right! Let no spirit of digression\\nOvercome you in the evil hour.\\nThere's the right and the wrong to ev'ry question;\\nBe safe thru inspiration's pow'r.\\n3. \\nChoose the right! There is peace in righteous doing.\\nChoose the right! There's safety for the soul.\\nChoose the right in all labors you're pursuing;\\nLet God and heaven be your goal.\\n1. \\nKnow this, that ev'ry soul is free\\nTo choose his life and what he'll be;\\nFor this eternal truth is giv'n:\\nThat God will force no man to heav'n.\\n2. \\nHe'll call, persuade, direct aright,\\nAnd bless with wisdom, love, and light,\\nIn nameless ways be good and kind,\\nBut never force the human mind.\\n3. \\nFreedom and reason make us men;\\nTake these away, what are we then?\\nMere animals, and just as well\\nThe beasts may think of heav'n or hell.\\n4. \\nMay we no more our pow'rs abuse,\\nBut ways of truth and goodness choose;\\nOur God is pleased when we improve\\nHis grace and seek his perfect love.\\n1. \\nWhen upon life's billows you are tempest-tossed,\\nWhen you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,\\nCount your many blessings; name them one by one,\\nAnd it will surprise you what the Lord has done.\\n2. \\nAre you ever burdened with a load of care?\\nDoes the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?\\nCount your many blessings; ev'ry doubt will fly,\\nAnd you will be singing as the days go by.\\n3. \\nWhen you look at others with their lands and gold,\\nThink that Christ has promised you his wealth untold.\\nCount your many blessings; money cannot buy\\nYour reward in heaven nor your home on high.\\n4. \\nSo amid the conflict, whether great or small,\\nDo not be discouraged; God is over all.\\nCount your many blessings; angels will attend,\\nHelp and comfort give you to your journey's end.\\nPraise God, from whom all blessings flow;\\nPraise him, all creatures here below;\\nPraise him above, ye heav'nly host;\\nPraise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\\n1. \\nLet us all press on in the work of the Lord,\\nThat when life is o'er we may gain a reward;\\nIn the fight for right let us wield a sword,\\nThe mighty sword of truth.\\n2. \\nWe will not retreat, though our numbers may be few\\nWhen compared with the opposite host in view;\\nBut an unseen pow'r will aid me and you\\nIn the glorious cause of truth.\\n3. \\nIf we do what's right we have no need to fear,\\nFor the Lord, our helper, will ever be near;\\nIn the days of trial his Saints he will cheer,\\nAnd prosper the cause of truth.\\n1. \\n'\\x80\\x9cCome along, come along'\\x80\\x9d is the call that will win,\\nTo lead us to virtue and keep us from sin;\\nMost men can be led, but few can be driv'n\\nIn shunning perdition and striving for heav'n.\\n2. \\n'\\x80\\x9cCome to me, come to me'\\x80\\x9d sweetly falls on the ear,\\nThe word of the Lord full of comfort and cheer,\\nTo bind up the broken, the captive set free,\\nIn the good time that's coming, we hope soon to see.\\n3. \\nLet us govern by kindness and never by force,\\nAll cheering and bright, like the sun in its course;\\nObedience will spring from each heart with a bound,\\nAnd brotherhood flourish the wide world around.\\n1. \\nThis house we dedicate to thee,\\nOur God, our fathers' God.\\nWilt thou accept and deign to bless\\nThe path our feet have trod?\\n2. \\nWilt thou thy servants here inspire\\nWhen in thy name they speak?\\nAnd wilt thou bless each contrite soul\\nWho here thy face doth seek?\\n3. \\nHere may our sons and daughters come\\nAnd find that peace which swells\\nFrom grateful hearts, when touched by thee,\\nWherein thy Spirit dwells!\\n1. \\nOnward, Christian soldiers!\\nMarching as to war,\\nWith the cross of Jesus\\nGoing on before.\\nChrist, the royal Master,\\nLeads against the foe;\\nForward into battle,\\nSee his banners go!\\n2. \\nAt the sign of triumph\\nSatan's host doth flee;\\nOn, then, Christian soldiers,\\nOn to victory.\\nHell's foundations quiver\\nAt the shout of praise;\\nBrothers, lift your voices,\\nLoud your anthems raise.\\n3. \\nLike a mighty army\\nMoves the Church of God;\\nBrothers, we are treading\\nWhere the Saints have trod.\\nWe are not divided;\\nAll one body we:\\nOne in hope and doctrine,\\nOne in charity.\\n4. \\nOnward, then, ye people;\\nJoin our happy throng.\\nBlend with ours your voices\\nIn the triumph song:\\nGlory, laud, and honor\\nUnto Christ, the King.\\nThis through countless ages\\nMen and angels sing.\\n1. \\nWe love thy house, O God,\\nWherein thine honor dwells.\\nThe joy of thine abode\\nAll earthly joy excels.\\n2. \\nIt is the house of prayer,\\nWherein thy servants meet,\\nAnd thou, O Lord, art there,\\nThy chosen flock to greet.\\n3. \\nWe love the word of life,\\nThe word that tells of peace,\\nOf comfort in the strife,\\nOf joys that never cease.\\n1. \\nUp, awake, ye defenders of Zion!\\nThe foe's at the door of your homes;\\nLet each heart be the heart of a lion,\\nUnyielding and proud as he roams.\\nRemember the trials of Missouri;\\nForget not the courage of Nauvoo.\\nWhen the enemy host is before you,\\nStand firm and be faithful and true.\\nStand firm and be faithful and true,\\nStand firm and be faithful and true;\\nWhen the enemy host is before you,\\nStand firm and be faithful and true.\\n2. \\nBy His power is Zion surrounded;\\nHer warriors are noble and brave,\\nAnd their faith on Jehovah is

faithful and true.\\nAnd we'll always be faithful and true,\\nAnd we'll always be faithful and true;\\nWe'll not rest till our foes are retreating,\\nAnd we'll always be faithful and true.\\n3. \\nTho, assisted by legions infernal,\\nThe plundering foemen advance,\\nWith a host from the regions eternal\\nWe'll scatter their troops at a glance.\\nSoon the kingdom will be independent;\\nIn wonder the nations will view\\nOur Zion in glory resplendent;\\nThen let us be faithful and true.\\nThen let us be faithful and true,\\nThen let us be faithful and true;\\nOur Zion in glory resplendent;\\nThen let us be faithful and true.\\n1. \\nCalled to serve Him, heav'nly King of glory,\\nChosen e'er to witness for his name,\\nFar and wide we tell the Father's story,\\nFar and wide

'Tis the last and the first,\\nFor the limits of time it steps o'er.\\nTho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst,\\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\\nEternal, unchanged, evermore.\\n1. \\nTruth reflects upon our senses;\\nGospel light reveals to some.\\nIf there still should be offenses,\\nWoe to them by whom they come!\\nJudge not, that ye be not judged,\\nWas the counsel Jesus gave;\\nMeasure given, large or grudged,\\nJust the same you must receive.\\n2. \\nJesus said, '\\x80\\x9cBe meek and lowly,'\\x80\\x9d\\nFor 'tis high to be a judge;\\nIf I would be pure and holy,\\nI must love without a grudge.\\nIt requires a constant labor\\nAll his precepts to obey.\\nIf I truly love my neighbor,\\nI am in the narrow way.\\n3. \\nOnce I said unto another,\\n'\\x80\\x9cIn thine eye there is a mote;\\nIf thou art a friend, a brother,\\nHold, and let me pull it out.'\\x80\\x9d\\nBut I could not see it fairly,\\nFor my sight was very dim.\\nWhen I came to search more clearly,\\nIn mine eye there was a beam.\\n4. \\nIf I love my brother dearer,\\nAnd his mote I would erase,\\nThen the light should shine the clearer,\\nFor the eye's a tender place.\\nOthers I have oft reproved\\nFor an object like a mote;\\nNow I wish this beam removed;\\nOh, that tears would wash it out!\\n5. \\nCharity and love are healing;\\nThese will give the clearest sight;\\nWhen I saw my brother's failing,\\nI was not exactly right.\\nNow I'll take no further trouble;\\nJesus' love is all my theme;\\nLittle motes are but a bubble\\nWhen I think upon the beam.\\n1. \\nTo Nephi, seer of olden time,\\nA vision came from God,\\nWherein the holy word sublime\\nWas shown an iron rod.\\n2. \\nWhile on our journey here below,\\nBeneath temptation's pow'r,\\nThrough mists of darkness we must go,\\nIn peril ev'ry hour.\\n3. \\nAnd when temptation's pow'r is nigh,\\nOur pathway clouded o'er,\\nUpon the rod we can rely,\\nAnd heaven's aid implore.\\n4. \\nAnd, hand o'er hand, the rod along,\\nThrough each succeeding day,\\nWith earnest prayer and hopeful song,\\nWe'll still pursue our way.\\n5. \\nAfar we see the golden rest\\nTo which the rod will guide,\\nWhere, with the angels bright and blest,\\nForever we'll abide.\\n1. \\nA voice hath spoken from the dust,\\nIts message pure, without alloy,\\nOf treasured hope and sacred trust:\\nOh, '\\x80\\x9cmen are that they might have joy.'\\x80\\x9d\\n2. \\nShould sorrow come, we'll not despair,\\nFor He would not that men should pine.\\nThe grief that comes we'll learn to bear\\nUntil again the sun doth shine.\\n3. \\nBefore the Lord, then, humbly go.\\nHis message will our spirits buoy.\\nOn us his blessings he'll bestow,\\nFor '\\x80\\x9cmen are that they might have joy.'\\x80\\x9d\\n1. \\nWhen the rosy light of morning\\nSoftly beams above the hill,\\nAnd the birds, sweet heav'nly songsters,\\nEv'ry dell with music fill,\\nFresh from slumber we awaken;\\nSunshine chases clouds away.\\nNature breathes her sweetest fragrance\\nOn the holy Sabbath day.\\n2. \\nFor a good and glorious purpose\\nThus we meet each Sabbath day,\\nEach one striving for salvation\\nThru the Lord's appointed way.\\nEarnest toil will be rewarded;\\nZealous hearts need not repine.\\nGod will not withhold his blessings\\nFrom the eager, seeking mind.\\n3. \\nLet us then press boldly onward,\\nProve ourselves as soldiers true.\\nHe will lead us; he will guide us.\\nCome, there's work for all to do,\\nNever tiring, never doubting,\\nBoldly struggling to the end.\\nIn the world, tho foes assail us,\\nGod will surely be our friend.\\n1. \\nAs I search the holy scriptures,\\nLoving Father of mankind,\\nMay my heart be blessed with wisdom,\\nAnd may knowledge fill my mind.\\n2. \\nAs I search the holy scriptures,\\nTouch my spirit, Lord, I pray.\\nMay life's myst'ries be unfolded\\nAs I study day by day.\\n3. \\nAs I search the holy scriptures,\\nMay thy mercy be revealed.\\nSoothe my troubled heart and spirit;\\nMay my unseen wounds be healed.\\n4. \\nAs I search the holy scriptures,\\nHelp me ponder and obey.\\nIn thy word is life eternal;\\nMay thy light show me the way.\\n1. \\nThanks for the Sabbath School. Hail to the day\\nWhen evil and error are fleeing away.\\nThanks for our teachers who labor with care\\nThat we in the light of the gospel may share.\\n2. \\nNow in the morning of life let us try\\nEach virtue to cherish, all vice to decry;\\nStrive with the noble in deeds that exalt,\\nAnd battle with energy each childish fault.\\n3. \\nMay we endeavor through life's devious way\\nTo watch and be earnest, true wisdom display;\\nTry to o'ercome each temptation and snare,\\nThereby full salvation eternally share.\\n1. \\nWe love to hear thy holy word\\nProclaimed in latter days.\\nIt lifts our hearts; our souls are stirred\\nTo glorify thy ways.\\n2. \\nWe love to read thy holy word\\nWith quiet thought and prayer.\\nThy Spirit's whisp'rings we have heard;\\nWe feel thy

are earnest in our labors.\\nTo God's kingdom we belong.\\nTrials make our faith grow stronger;\\nTruth is nobler than a crown.\\nWe will brave the tempest longer\\nTho the world upon us frown.\\n1. \\nHelp me teach with inspiration;\\nGrant this blessing, Lord, I pray.\\nHelp me lift a soul's ambition\\nTo a higher, nobler way.\\n2. \\nHelp me reach a friend in darkness;\\nHelp me guide him thru

ever sweet retreat\\nTheir blessed teachings hear;\\nWith precious truths our minds are stored,\\nThe gospel plan made plain.\\nEach Sabbath day, with one accord,\\nOh, let us meet again.\\n1. \\nThe glorious gospel light has shone\\nIn this the latter day\\nWith such intelligence that none\\nFrom truth need turn away.\\nThe precious things which had been sealed\\nAnd from the world kept hid,\\nThe Lord has to his Saints revealed\\nAs anciently he did.\\n2. \\nAnd thru the priesthood now restored\\nAgain prepared the way\\nThru which the dead may hear his word\\nAnd all his laws obey.\\nAs Christ to spirits went to preach\\nWho were to prison led,\\nSo many Saints have gone to teach\\nThe gospel to the dead.\\n3. \\nAnd we for them can be baptized,\\nYes, for our friends most dear,\\nThat they can with the just be raised\\nWhen Gabriel's trump they hear;\\nThat they may come with Christ again\\nWhen he to earth descends,\\nA thousand years with him to reign,\\nAnd with their earthly friends.\\n4. \\nNow, O ye Saints, rejoice today\\nThat you can saviors be\\nOf all your dead who will obey\\nThe gospel and be free.\\nThen let us rise without restraint\\nAnd act for those we love,\\nFor they are giving their consent\\nAnd wait for us to move.\\n1. \\nIf you could hie to Kolob\\nIn the twinkling of an eye,\\nAnd then continue onward\\nWith that same speed to fly,\\nDo you think that you could ever,\\nThrough all eternity,\\nFind out the generation\\nWhere Gods began to be?\\n2. \\nOr see the grand beginning,\\nWhere space did not extend?\\nOr view the last creation,\\nWhere Gods and matter end?\\nMethinks the Spirit whispers,\\n'\\x80\\x9cNo man has found '\\x80\\x98pure space,'\\nNor seen the outside curtains,\\nWhere nothing has a place.'\\x80\\x9d\\n3. \\nThe works of God continue,\\nAnd worlds and lives abound;\\nImprovement and progression\\nHave one eternal round.\\nThere is no end to matter;\\nThere is no end to

plants his footsteps in the sea\\nAnd rides upon the storm.\\n2. \\nYe fearful Saints, fresh courage take;\\nThe clouds ye so much dread\\nAre big with mercy and shall break\\nIn blessings on your head.\\n3. \\nHis purposes will ripen fast,\\nUnfolding ev'ry hour;\\nThe bud may have a bitter taste,\\nBut sweet will be the flower.\\n4. \\nBlind unbelief is sure to err\\nAnd scan his works in vain;\\nGod is his own interpreter,\\nAnd he will make it plain.\\n1. \\nOh, what songs of the heart\\nWe shall sing all the day,\\nWhen again we assemble at home,\\nWhen we meet ne'er to part\\nWith the blest o'er the way,\\nThere no more from our loved ones to roam!\\nWhen we meet ne'er to part,\\nOh, what songs of the heart\\nWe shall sing in our beautiful home.\\n2. \\nTho our rapture and bliss\\nThere's no song can express,\\nWe will shout, we will sing o'er and o'er,\\nAs we greet with a kiss,\\nAnd with joy we caress\\nAll our loved ones that passed on before;\\nAs we greet with a kiss,\\nIn our rapture and bliss,\\nAll our loved ones that passed on before.\\n3. \\nOh, the visions we'll see\\nIn that home of the blest,\\nThere's no word, there's no thought can impart,\\nBut our rapture will be\\nAll the soul can attest,\\nIn the heavenly songs of the heart;\\nBut our rapture will be\\nIn the vision we'll see\\nBest expressed in the songs of the heart.\\n4. \\nOh, what songs we'll employ!\\nOh, what welcome we'll hear!\\nWhile our transports of love are complete,\\nAs the heart swells with joy\\nIn embraces most dear\\nWhen our heavenly parents we meet!\\nAs the heart swells with joy,\\nOh, what songs we'll employ,\\nWhen our heavenly parents we meet!\\n1. \\nRise, ye Saints, and temples enter;\\nSeek the path that leads ahead.\\nSeal in everlasting circles\\nAll our loved ones, quick and dead.\\n2. \\nLearn the plan of exaltation;\\nWith His sacred laws comply.\\nLive to earn in binding cov'nant\\nBlessings of our God most high.\\n3. \\nElohim, thou great designer,\\nWilt thou heaven's pow'rs bestow,\\nAs thy faithful sons and daughters\\nServe in temples here below.\\n1. \\nHow beautiful thy temples, Lord!\\nEach one a sacred shrine,\\nWhere faithful Saints, with one accord,\\nEngage in work divine.\\nHow beautiful some aid to give\\nTo dear ones we call dead,\\nBut who indeed as spirits live;\\nThey've only gone ahead.\\n2. \\nHow beautiful thy message, Lord,\\nThe gospel, pure and true,\\nIn these our days to earth restored\\nAnd taught to men anew.\\nHow beautiful its faith and hope;\\nAll mankind it would save,\\nIncluding in its aim and scope\\nThe souls beyond the grave.\\n3. \\nHow beautiful thy promise, Lord,\\nThat we may grow in truth,\\nAnd live, exalted by thy word,\\nIn endless, glorious youth.\\nWith loved ones sealed in holiness\\nBy sacred temple rites,\\nWorlds without end we may progress\\nFrom heights to greater heights.\\n1. \\nHoly temples on Mount Zion\\nIn a lofty splendor shine,\\nAvenues to exaltation,\\nSymbols of a love divine.\\nAnd their kindly portals beckon\\nTo serenity and prayer,\\nValiant children of the promise,\\nPledged to sacred service there.\\n2. \\nMerciful and gracious Father,\\nPurify our hearts, we pray;\\nBless our mission of redemption\\nIn thy hallowed house each day,\\nTill at length our faithful kindred,\\nSealed with us eternally\\nIn celestial bonds of union,\\nSing hosannas unto thee.\\n3. \\nSing aloud, ye heav'nly chorus,\\nAnthems of eternal praise\\nTo the glorious King Immanuel!\\nSing with Saints of latter days!\\nLet the mountains shout for gladness,\\nAnd the valleys joyful be,\\nWhile the stars acclaim in rapture,\\nFor the prisoners shall go free.\\n1. \\nRejoice, ye Saints of latter days,\\nFor temples now in many lands,\\nWhere Saints, endowed with pow'r from God,\\nMay learn to keep the Lord's commands,\\nMay learn to keep the Lord's commands.\\n2. \\nCome, let us go up to his house;\\nWe'll make our covenants and say:\\n'\\x80\\x9cAll we are giv'n we give to thee.\\nAccept our love; we will obey.\\nAccept our love; we will obey.'\\x80\\x9d\\n3. \\nO Saints, rejoice! Our kindred dead\\nMay now receive eternally\\nThe fulness of the gospel's joy.\\nArise, ye Saints, and set them free!\\nArise, ye Saints, and set them free!\\n4. \\nHis earthly kingdom now prepares\\nTo greet his kingdom from above.\\nThen will the heavens shout for joy,\\nAnd Christ descend to reign in love,\\nAnd Christ descend to reign in love.\\n1. \\nTurn your hearts; the Lord is coming,\\nMalachi the prophet said.\\nTurn your hearts in preparation\\nTo the work of exaltation\\nFor the living and the dead.\\n2. \\nIn the latter days Elijah\\nWill renew the plan sublime.\\nHe will teach you and remind you\\nOf the promises that bind you\\nTo all men throughout all time.\\n3. \\nTurn your hearts toward your parents'\\x80\\x94\\nGenerations gone before.\\nMay you seek until you find them;\\nIn the temple seal and bind them\\nTo your hearts forevermore.\\n4. \\nTurn in love to all your children'\\x80\\x94\\nGenerations yet to be.\\nMay your deeds of gospel giving,\\nTemple service, righteous living,\\nBless them all eternally.\\n1. \\nO my Father, thou that dwellest\\nIn the high and glorious place,\\nWhen shall I regain thy presence\\nAnd again behold thy face?\\nIn thy holy habitation,\\nDid my spirit once reside?\\nIn my first primeval childhood\\nWas I nurtured near thy side?\\n2. \\nFor a wise and glorious purpose\\nThou hast placed me here on earth\\nAnd withheld the recollection\\nOf my former friends and birth;\\nYet ofttimes a secret something\\nWhispered, '\\x80\\x9cYou're a stranger here,'\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd I felt that I had wandered\\nFrom a more exalted sphere.\\n3. \\nI had learned to call thee Father,\\nThru thy Spirit from on high,\\nBut, until the key of knowledge\\nWas restored, I knew not why.\\nIn the heav'ns are parents single?\\nNo, the thought makes reason stare!\\nTruth is reason; truth eternal\\nTells me I've a mother there.\\n4. \\nWhen I leave this frail existence,\\nWhen I lay this mortal by,\\nFather, Mother, may I meet you\\nIn your royal courts on high?\\nThen, at length, when I've completed\\nAll you sent me forth to do,\\nWith your mutual approbation\\nLet me come and dwell with you.\\n1. \\nEach life that touches ours for good\\nReflects thine own great mercy, Lord;\\nThou sendest blessings from above\\nThru words and deeds of those who love.\\n2. \\nWhat greater gift dost thou bestow,\\nWhat greater goodness can we know\\nThan Christlike friends, whose gentle ways\\nStrengthen our faith, enrich our days.\\n3. \\nWhen such a friend from us departs,\\nWe hold forever in our hearts\\nA sweet and hallowed memory,\\nBringing us nearer, Lord, to thee.\\n4. \\nFor worthy friends whose lives proclaim\\nDevotion to the Savior's name,\\nWho bless our days with peace and

\\nFather, turn thine ear to me;\\nLet me offer thanks to thee\\nFor thy wise and tender care\\nOf thy children ev'rywhere.\\n1. \\nIn our lovely Deseret,\\nWhere the Saints of God have met,\\nThere's a multitude of children all around.\\nThey are generous and brave;\\nThey have precious souls to save;\\nThey must listen and obey the gospel's sound.\\n2. \\nThat the children may live long\\nAnd be

kind.\\n4. \\nThey must not forget to pray,\\nNight and morning ev'ry day,\\nFor the Lord to keep them safe from ev'ry ill,\\nAnd assist them to do right,\\nThat with all their mind and might\\nThey may love him and may learn to do his will.\\nAs I have loved you,\\nLove one another.\\nThis new commandment:\\nLove one another.\\nBy this shall men know\\nYe are my disciples,\\nIf ye have

from day to day,\\nTo shed a holy light around our way,\\nTo shed a holy light around our way.\\n3. \\nWe ever pray for thee with fervent love;\\nAnd as the children's prayer is heard above,\\nThou shalt be ever blest, and God will give\\nAll that is meet and best while thou shalt live,\\nAll that is meet and best while thou shalt live.\\n1. \\nEarth, with her ten thousand flow'rs,\\nAir, with all its beams and show'rs,\\nHeaven's infinite expanse,\\nSea's resplendent countenance'\\x80\\x94\\nAll around and all above\\nBear this record: God is love.\\n2. \\nSounds among the vales and hills,\\nIn the woods and by the rills,\\nOf the breeze and of the bird,\\nBy the gentle murmur stirred'\\x80\\x94\\nSacred songs, beneath, above,\\nHave one chorus: God is love.\\n3. \\nAll the hopes

goodness stands approved,\\nUnchanged from day to day;\\nI'll drop my burden at his feet\\nAnd bear a song away.\\n1. \\nJesus, the very thought of thee\\nWith sweetness fills my breast;\\nBut sweeter far thy face to see\\nAnd in thy presence rest.\\n2. \\nNor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,\\nNor can the mem'ry find\\nA sweeter sound than thy blest name,\\nO Savior of mankind!\\n3. \\nO hope of ev'ry contrite heart,\\nO joy of all the meek,\\nTo those who fall, how kind thou art!\\nHow good to those who seek!\\n4. \\nJesus, our only joy be thou,\\nAs thou our prize wilt be;\\nJesus, be thou our glory now,\\nAnd thru eternity.\\n1. \\nThe Lord is my Shepherd; no want shall I know.\\nI feed in green pastures; safe-folded I rest.\\nHe leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,\\nRestores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppressed,\\nRestores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppressed.\\n2. \\nThru the valley and shadow of death though I stray,\\nSince thou art my Guardian, no evil I fear.\\nThy rod shall defend me, thy staff be my stay.\\nNo harm can befall with my Comforter near.\\nNo harm can befall with my Comforter near.\\n3. \\nIn the midst of affliction my table is spread.\\nWith blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o'er.\\nWith perfume and oil thou anointest my head.\\nOh, what shall I ask of thy providence more?\\nOh, what shall I ask of thy providence more?\\n1. \\nSweet is the work, my God, my King,\\nTo praise thy name, give thanks and sing,\\nTo show thy love by morning light,\\nAnd talk of all thy truths at night.\\n2. \\nSweet is the day of sacred rest.\\nNo mortal care shall seize my breast.\\nOh, may my heart in tune be found,\\nLike David's harp of solemn sound!\\n3. \\nMy heart shall triumph in my Lord\\nAnd bless his works and bless his word.\\nThy works of grace, how bright they shine!\\nHow deep thy counsels, how divine!\\n4. \\nBut, oh, what triumph shall I raise\\nTo thy dear name through endless days,\\nWhen

the pure and the free.\\n2. \\nThe harvest is great, and the lab'rers are few;\\nBut if we're united, we all things can do.\\nWe'll gather the wheat from the midst of the tares\\nAnd bring them from bondage, from sorrows and snares.\\n3. \\nWe'll go to the poor, like our Captain of old,\\nAnd visit the weary, the hungry, and cold;\\nWe'll cheer up their hearts with the news that he bore\\nAnd point them to Zion and life evermore.\\n1. \\nBrethren, pow'r by earthly standards\\nComes by rank or wealth or sword;\\nBut the pow'r above all others\\nIs the priesthood of our Lord.\\n2. \\nIt is ours, the total armor'\\x80\\x94\\nPriesthood held by Christ, our Lord'\\x80\\x94\\nIf, as brethren, we are worthy\\nOf the Spirit's whispered word.\\n3. \\nLet us venture forth in freedom\\nWith the priesthood as our guide'\\x80\\x94\\nDeacons, teachers, priests, and elders,\\nSeeking virtue side by side.\\n1. \\nYe who are called to labor and minister for God,\\nBlest with the royal priesthood, appointed by his word\\nTo preach among the nations the news of gospel grace,\\nAnd publish on the mountains salvation, truth, and peace:\\n2. \\nOh, let not vain ambition nor worldly glory stain\\nYour minds so pure and holy; acquit yourselves like men.\\nWhile lifting up your voices like trumpets long and loud,\\nSay to the slumb'ring nation: '\\x80\\x9cPrepare to meet your God!'\\x80\\x9d\\n3. \\nThen cease from all light speeches, light-mindedness, and pride;\\nPray always without ceasing and in the truth abide.\\nThe Comforter will teach you, his richest blessings send.\\nYour Savior will be with you forever to the end.\\n4. \\nRich blessings there await you, and God will give you faith.\\nYou shall be crowned with glory and triumph over death,\\nAnd soon you'll come to Zion and, bearing each his sheaf,\\nNo more shall taste of sorrow, but glorious crowns receive.\\n1. \\nCome, all ye sons of God who have received the priesthood;\\nGo spread the gospel wide and gather in his people.\\nThe latter-day work has begun:\\nTo gather scattered Israel in\\nAnd bring them back to Zion to praise the Lamb.\\n2. \\nCome, all ye scattered sheep, and listen to your Shepherd,\\nWhile you the blessings reap which long have been predicted.\\nBy prophets long it's been foretold:\\nHe'll gather you into his fold\\nAnd bring you home to Zion to praise the Lamb.\\n3. \\nRepent and be baptized, and have your sins remitted,\\nAnd get the Spirit's zeal; oh, then you'll be united.\\nGo cast upon him all your care;\\nHe will regard your humble prayer\\nAnd bring you home to Zion to praise the Lamb.\\n4. \\nAnd when your grief is o'er and ended your affliction,\\nYour spirits then will soar to await the Resurrection;\\nAnd then his presence you'll enjoy,\\nIn heav'nly bliss your time employ,\\nA thousand years in Zion to praise the Lamb.\\nRise up, O men of God!\\nHave done with lesser things.\\nGive heart and soul and mind and strength\\nTo serve the King of Kings.\\nRise up, O men of God,\\nIn one united throng.\\nBring in the day of brotherhood\\nAnd end the night of wrong.\\nRise up, O men of God!\\nTread where his feet have trod.\\nAs brothers of the Son of Man,\\nRise up, O men of God!\\nRise up! Rise up! Rise up!\\n1. \\nRise up, O men of God!\\nHave done with lesser things.\\nGive heart and soul and mind and strength\\nTo serve the King of Kings.\\n2. \\nRise up, O men of God,\\nIn one united throng.\\nBring in the day of brotherhood\\nAnd end the night of wrong.\\n3. \\nRise up, O men of God!\\nTread where his feet have trod.\\nAs brothers of the Son of Man,\\nRise up, O men of God!\\n1. \\nSee the mighty priesthood gathered;\\nFirm in serried ranks they stand'\\x80\\x94\\nSon and father jointly serving,\\nGathered in from ev'ry land.\\nProud their voices blend together,\\nRaising hymns to Father's praise,\\nSending forth the gospel message\\nAs restored in latter days.\\n2. \\nAs to Seth his father, Adam,\\nPow'rful precepts did impart,\\nHumbly each receives the message\\nSpoken from a prophet's heart.\\nLine on line, truth is revealed,\\nTill all darkness flees away\\nIn the face of perfect knowledge,\\nWhere celestial laws hold sway.\\n3. \\nCome, ye sons, and walk uprightly,\\nAs your noble fathers trod'\\x80\\x94\\nBearers of the Savior's priesthood,\\nHolding firm the iron rod'\\x80\\x94\\nTill Satan's pow'rs are vanquished,\\nBound in chains he conquered lies,\\nAnd our glorious hallelujahs\\nLoudly sound across the skies,\\nAnd our glorious hallelujahs\\nLoudly sound, loudly sound across the skies.\\n1. \\nCome, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;\\nBut with joy wend your way.\\nThough hard to you this journey may appear,\\nGrace shall be as your day.\\n'Tis better far for us to strive\\nOur useless cares from us to drive;\\nDo this, and joy your hearts will swell'\\x80\\x94\\nAll is well! All is well!\\n2. \\nWhy should we mourn or think our lot is hard?\\n'Tis not so; all is right.\\nWhy should we think to earn a great reward\\nIf we now shun the fight?\\nGird up your loins; fresh courage take.\\nOur God will never us forsake;\\nAnd soon we'll have this tale to tell'\\x80\\x94\\nAll is well! All is well!\\n3. \\nWe'll find the place which God for us prepared,\\nFar away in the West,\\nWhere none shall come to hurt or make afraid;\\nThere the Saints will be blessed.\\nWe'll make the air with music ring,\\nShout praises to our God and King;\\nAbove the rest these words we'll tell'\\x80\\x94\\nAll is well! All is well!\\n4. \\nAnd should we die before our journey's through,\\nHappy day! All is well!\\nWe then are free from toil and sorrow, too;\\nWith the just we shall dwell!\\nBut if our lives are spared again\\nTo see the Saints their rest obtain,\\nOh, how we'll make this chorus swell'\\x80\\x94\\nAll is well! All is well!\\n1. \\nGo, ye messengers of heaven,\\nChosen by divine command;\\nGo and publish free salvation\\nTo a dark, benighted land.\\n2. \\nGo to island, vale, and mountain;\\nThere fulfill the great command;\\nGather out the sons of Jacob\\nTo possess the promised land.\\n3. \\nWhen your thousands all are gathered,\\nAnd their prayers for you ascend,\\nAnd the Lord has crowned with blessings\\nAll the labors of your hand,\\n4. \\nThen the song of joy and transport\\nWill from ev'ry land resound;\\nThen the nations long in darkness\\nBy the Savior will be crowned.\\n1. \\nAn angel from on high\\nThe long, long silence broke;\\nDescending from the sky,\\nThese gracious words he spoke:\\nLo! in Cumorah's lonely hill\\nA sacred record lies concealed.\\nLo! in Cumorah's lonely hill\\nA sacred record lies concealed.\\n2. \\nSealed by Moroni's hand,\\nIt has for ages lain\\nTo wait the Lord's command,\\nFrom dust to speak again.\\nIt shall again to light come forth\\nTo usher in Christ's reign on earth.\\nIt shall again to light come forth\\nTo usher in Christ's reign on earth.\\n3. \\nIt speaks of Joseph's seed\\nAnd makes the remnant known\\nOf nations long since dead,\\nWho once had dwelt alone.\\nThe fulness of the gospel, too,\\nIts pages will reveal to view.\\nThe fulness of the gospel, too,\\nIts pages will reveal to view.\\n4. \\nThe time is now fulfilled,\\nThe long-expected day;\\nLet earth obedience yield\\nAnd darkness flee away.\\nRemove the seals; be wide unfurled\\nIts light and glory to the world.\\nRemove the seals; be wide unfurled\\nIts light and glory to the world.\\n5. \\nLo! Israel filled with joy\\nShall now be gathered home,\\nTheir wealth and means employ\\nTo build Jerusalem,\\nWhile Zion shall arise and shine\\nAnd fill the earth with truth divine.\\nWhile Zion shall arise and shine\\nAnd fill the earth with truth divine.\\n1. \\nThy servants are prepared\\nTo teach thy word abroad,\\nTo gather in thy sheep\\nTo thee, O Lamb of God.\\n2. \\nLet these, thy servants, speak\\nWith heart and voice of youth,\\nAnd fill the world's dark lamps\\nWith light, the flame of truth.\\n3. \\nIn all of Zion's stakes\\nThy love shall conquer night,\\nWhile darkness draws away\\nFrom thy revealing light.\\n1. \\nSee, the mighty angel flying;\\nSee, he speeds his way to earth\\nTo proclaim the blessed gospel\\nAnd restore the ancient faith,\\nAnd restore, and restore the ancient faith.\\n2. \\nHear, O men, the proclamation;\\nCease from vanity and strife.\\nHasten to receive the gospel\\nAnd obey the words of life,\\nAnd obey, and obey the words of life.\\n3. \\nSoon the earth will hear the warning;\\nThen the judgments will descend!\\nOh, before the days of sorrow,\\nMake the Lord of Hosts your friend!\\nMake the Lord, make the Lord of Hosts your friend!\\n4. \\nThen when dangers are around you\\nAnd the wicked are distressed,\\nYou, with all the Saints of Zion,\\nShall enjoy eternal rest,\\nShall enjoy, shall enjoy eternal rest.\\n1. \\nOh say, what is truth? 'Tis the fairest gem\\nThat the riches of worlds can produce,\\nAnd priceless the value of truth will be when\\nThe proud monarch's costliest diadem\\nIs counted but dross and refuse.\\n2. \\nYes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize\\nTo which mortals or Gods can aspire.\\nGo search in the depths where it glittering lies,\\nOr ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies:\\n'Tis an aim for the noblest desire.\\n3. \\nThe sceptre may fall from the despot's grasp\\nWhen with winds of stern justice he copes.\\nBut the pillar of truth will endure to the last,\\nAnd its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast\\nAnd the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes.\\n4. \\nThen say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,\\nFor the limits of time it steps o'er.\\nTho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst,\\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\\nEternal, unchanged, evermore.\\n1. \\nCome, O thou King of Kings!\\nWe've waited long for thee,\\nWith healing in thy wings,\\nTo set thy people free.\\nCome, thou desire of nations, come;\\nLet Israel now be gathered home.\\n2. \\nCome, make an end to sin,\\nAnd cleanse the earth by fire,\\nAnd righteousness bring in,\\nThat Saints may tune the lyre\\nWith songs of joy, a happier strain,\\nTo welcome in thy peaceful reign.\\n3. \\nHosannas now shall sound\\nFrom all the ransomed throng,\\nAnd glory echo round\\nA new triumphal song;\\nThe wide expanse of heaven fill\\nWith anthems sweet from Zion's hill.\\n4. \\nHail! Prince of life and peace!\\nThrice welcome to thy throne!\\nWhile all the chosen race\\nTheir Lord and Savior own,\\nThe heathen nations bow the knee,\\nAnd ev'ry tongue sounds praise to thee.\\n1. \\nHigh on the mountain top\\nA banner is unfurled.\\nYe nations, now look up;\\nIt waves to all the world.\\nIn Deseret's sweet, peaceful land,\\nOn Zion's mount behold it stand!\\n2. \\nFor God remembers still\\nHis promise made of old\\nThat he on Zion's hill\\nTruth's standard would unfold!\\nHer light should there attract the gaze\\nOf all the world in latter days.\\n3. \\nHis house shall there be reared,\\nHis glory to display,\\nAnd people shall be heard\\nIn distant lands to say:\\nWe'll now go up and serve the Lord,\\nObey his truth and learn his word.\\n4. \\nFor there we shall be taught\\nThe law that will go forth,\\nWith truth and wisdom fraught,\\nTo govern all the earth.\\nForever there his ways we'll tread,\\nAnd save ourselves with all our dead.\\n1. \\nI need thee every hour,\\nMost gracious Lord.\\nNo tender voice like thine\\nCan peace afford.\\n2. \\nI need thee every hour;\\nStay thou nearby.\\nTemptations lose their pow'r\\nWhen thou art nigh.\\n3. \\nI need thee every hour,\\nIn joy or pain.\\nCome quickly and abide,\\nOr life is vain.\\n4. \\nI need thee every hour,\\nMost holy One.\\nOh, make me thine indeed,\\nThou blessed Son!\\n1. \\nBrightly beams our Father's mercy\\nFrom his lighthouse evermore,\\nBut to us he gives the keeping\\nOf the lights along the shore.\\n2. \\nDark the night of sin has settled;\\nLoud the angry billows roar.\\nEager eyes are watching, longing,\\nFor the lights along the shore.\\n3. \\nTrim your feeble lamp, my brother;\\nSome poor sailor, tempest-tossed,\\nTrying now to make the harbor,\\nIn the darkness may be lost.\\n1. \\nSchool thy feelings, O my brother;\\nTrain thy warm, impulsive soul.\\nDo not its emotions smother,\\nBut let wisdom's voice control.\\nSchool thy feelings; there is power\\nIn the cool, collected mind.\\nPassion shatters reason's tower,\\nMakes the clearest vision blind.\\n2. \\nSchool thy feelings; condemnation\\nNever pass on friend or foe,\\nThough the tide of accusation\\nLike a flood of truth may flow.\\nHear defense before deciding,\\nAnd a ray of light may gleam,\\nShowing thee what filth is hiding\\nUnderneath the shallow stream.\\n3. \\nShould affliction's acrid vial\\nBurst o'er thy unsheltered head,\\nSchool thy feelings to the trial;\\nHalf its bitterness hath fled.\\nArt thou falsely, basely, slandered?\\nDoes the world begin to frown?\\nGauge thy wrath by wisdom's standard;\\nKeep thy rising anger down.\\n4. \\nRest thyself on this assurance:\\nTime's a friend to innocence,\\nAnd the patient, calm endurance\\nWins respect and aids defense.\\nNoblest minds have finest feelings;\\nQuiv'ring strings a breath can move;\\nAnd the gospel's sweet revealings\\nTune them with the key of love.\\n5. \\nHearts so sensitively molded\\nStrongly fortified should be,\\nTrained to firmness and enfolded\\nIn a calm tranquility.\\nWound not willfully another;\\nConquer haste with reason's might;\\nSchool thy feelings, sister, brother;\\nTrain them in the path of right.\\n1. \\nO home belov'd, where'er I wander,\\nOn foreign land or distant sea,\\nAs time rolls by, my heart grows fonder\\nAnd yearns more lovingly for thee!\\nTho fair be nature's scenes around me,\\nAnd friends are ever kind and true,\\nTho joyous mirth and song surround me,\\nMy heart, my soul still yearn for you.\\n2. \\nThe flow'rs around me may be fairer\\nThan those that bloom upon thy hills;\\nThe streams, great, mighty treasure bearers,\\nMore noted may be than thy rills.\\nNo world renown my humble village\\nLike these great towns may proudly claim;\\nYet my fond heart doth thrill with rapture\\nWhene'er I hear thy humble name.\\n3. \\nYe valleys fair and snowcapped mountains,\\nYe peaceful hamlets 'mid the trees,\\nYe murm'ring streams and crystal fountains,\\nKissed by the cool, soft, balmy breeze,\\nWords cannot tell how well I love thee\\nNor speak my longing when I roam.\\nMy heart alone can cry to heaven,\\n'\\x80\\x9cGod bless my own dear mountain home.'\\x80\\x9d\\n1. \\nOh, beautiful for spacious skies,\\nFor amber waves of grain,\\nFor purple mountain majesties\\nAbove the fruited plain!\\nAmerica! America!\\nGod shed his grace on thee,\\nAnd crown thy good with brotherhood\\nFrom sea to shining sea.\\n2. \\nOh, beautiful for pilgrim feet,\\nWhose stern, impassioned stress\\nA thoroughfare of freedom beat\\nAcross the wilderness!\\nAmerica! America!\\nGod mend thine ev'ry flaw,\\nConfirm thy soul in self-control,\\nThy liberty in law.\\n3. \\nOh, beautiful for heroes proved\\nIn liberating strife,\\nWho more than self their country loved,\\nAnd mercy more than life!\\nAmerica! America!\\nMay God thy gold refine,\\nTill all success be nobleness,\\nAnd ev'ry gain divine.\\n4. \\nOh, beautiful for patriot dream\\nThat sees beyond the years\\nThine alabaster cities gleam,\\nUndimmed by human tears!\\nAmerica! America!\\nGod shed his grace on thee,\\nAnd crown thy good with brotherhood\\nFrom sea to shining sea.\\n1. \\nMy country, 'tis of thee,\\nSweet land of liberty,\\nOf thee I sing;\\nLand where my fathers died,\\nLand of the pilgrims' pride,\\nFrom ev'ry mountainside\\nLet freedom ring!\\n2. \\nMy native country, thee,\\nLand of the noble free,\\nThy name I love;\\nI love thy rocks and rills,\\nThy woods and templed hills.\\nMy heart with rapture thrills\\nLike that above.\\n3. \\nLet music swell the breeze\\nAnd ring from all the trees\\nSweet freedom's song;\\nLet mortal tongues awake;\\nLet all that breathe partake;\\nLet rocks their silence break,\\nThe sound prolong.\\n4. \\nOur fathers' God, to thee,\\nAuthor of liberty,\\nTo thee we sing;\\nLong may our land be bright\\nWith freedom's holy light.\\nProtect us by thy might,\\nGreat God, our King!\\n1. \\nOh say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,\\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,\\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,\\nO'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\\nAnd the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\\nGave proof thru the night that our flag was still there.\\nOh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\\n2. \\nOn the shore, dimly seen thru the mists of the deep,\\nWhere the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,\\nWhat is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,\\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,\\nIn full glory reflected now shines on the stream;\\n'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh, long may it wave\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\\n3. \\nOh, thus be it ever, when free men shall stand\\nBetween their loved homes and the war's desolation!\\nBlest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land\\nPraise the Pow'r that hath made and preserved us a nation!\\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\\nAnd this be our motto: '\\x80\\x9cIn God is our trust!'\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\\n1. \\nGod save our gracious king!\\nLong live our noble king!\\nGod save the king!\\nSend him victorious,\\nHappy and glorious,\\nLong to reign over us;\\nGod save the king!\\n2. \\nThy choicest gifts in store\\nOn him be pleased to pour;\\nLong may he reign!\\nMay he defend our laws,\\nAnd ever give us cause\\nTo sing with heart and voice,\\nGod save the king!\\n\""
